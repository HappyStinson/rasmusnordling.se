> Dream big. It's the first step to success. Just like that saying, shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll land among the stars. So aim high, aim higher than you ever thought you could because if it just wasn't meant to be, you'll still shine. - [Unknown](https://www.searchquotes.com/search/Aim_For_The_Stars/)
