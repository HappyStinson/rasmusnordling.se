New record! Cool

Hello again.

Initially, I want to say awesome work to Dali who set a new record on my game and thank you for playing. ðŸ™‚ Felt I could not be worse and now I have managed to get 31! Should I raise the limit to 30? It should offer a challenge and make the player spend a day or two before getting there.

Okay, introduction aside. Time for:

News - Flag Frenzy v0.4

- New update loop. Switch case statement with game state instead of if-else structure. To be able to handle Game Over in a nicer way
- Hold down space to hoist the flag. Now you do not have to smash it
- A clock that counts down before the game starts. Ready Set Go!
- The timer is a separate entity that talks to GameController and runs like a coroutine
- Added the text "Time left" in front of the time which is now printed in full seconds

I'm a little behind in my planning but it still feels good because what I have now is still playable. Missing just a few menus and graphics + sound. I should solve that until Monday.

Before you go, I have some questions for you who played:

- Is the speed when hoisting the flag good?
- Is it better to hold down a button compared to before (press many times)?
- What was your spontaneous reaction when you played? Both praise and neighs are desired.

I do not know if I will have time to fix everything this time, but if it is successful and if it is appreciated, I can always take the time to make more courses to version "two point zero".

For those of you who have not managed to get the game started, you must install [Unity Web Player](https://unity3d.com/webplayer).
Available for both Windows and Mac OS X and works with most browsers.
This must be played in the browser on a computer, just to clarify. It is not possible to play on your mobile phone if you have tried.

I want all of you to try to beat my record of 31 flags. ðŸ˜‰

Good luck!

/ Rasmus
