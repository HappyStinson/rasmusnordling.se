title: To live according to my life principles - part 1

Hello again,

In this series of posts I will share my current version of my life principles and how well I live by them. This will both help you to understand where I’m at the moment and also help me to identify in what areas I’m failing.<!--more-->

Yesterday I tried to do my weekly/monthly review but got frustrated with organizing in [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) and ended up reading on [Lifehack](https://lifehack.org) instead.
Anyone following the GTD-principles would agree that doing the weekly review is critical for staying on top of your life. So why do I struggle and procrastinate on this so much?
Well it might got to do with self reflection and I have been reflecting a lot lately. I actually came up with the idea for this post in the shower this morning and now I’m composing the beginning of it on my way to work.

The following quote comes from the *[7Life System](https://highexistence.com/7life-system-the-simple-structure-that-will-change-your-life/)*.
> Your principles are the foundation on which you stand, and if you don’t define them, you leave it to the world to do so for you. The 7Life system has you define seven principles – those core values that state who you are, how you behave and how you operate.

# Rasmus 7 Life Principles that is current June 2017

1. Help myself first, then help those who do good for others
2. Encourage others to follow their dreams and offer my help
3. Don't be judgmental towards strangers and avoid prejudice
4. Step out of my comfort zone as often as possible and face my fears regularly
5. [The Boy Scout Rule](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_08/index.html) > "Try and leave this world a little better than you found it." - Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell
6. Always choose the healthier option
7. Make a difference for others and share my knowledge in a polite way when possible

## Help myself first, then help those who do good for others

This is essential for achieving success. I agree it’s nice to help others and offer your services but you also need to think about your needs.
With personal/professional success often comes more money which in turn can be spent better and do more good than what would’ve been possible had I not advanced and just kept going in the [*rat race*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race). Now I'm more aware of the world around me and how to be successful. Goals are just dreams if you don't have a plan on how to achieve them.
I always keep my eyes open for organisations and individuals who contributes for a better future and some I help financially but I’m also volunteering.
My biggest focus right now is on tobacco prevention where work needs to be done both nationally and globally. Many lives can be saved by stopping the tobacco industry, so this is literally a matter of life and death.

A couple of weeks ago I was introduced to [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org) which I will look more into.

There are probably several reasons for me being stressed out, frustrated and over loaded. One of them is my weakness of not really being able to say No. I may be trying to save the world and forgetting about saving myself. But should I really slow down? People need me and so far I haven't seen anyone stepping up to fill my shoes. The world is not gonna change itself. Motivated people make change happen.

That was all for now, I have to practice on being more agile in my life and by breaking this up into smaller posts I can teach myself that publishing small “drafts” perhaps isn’t so scary.
Hopefully it will help me not procrastinating so much and I hope you all look forward to more content coming up!

As always, leave a comment if you have any questions, feedback or just want to contact me.

Be your best today
