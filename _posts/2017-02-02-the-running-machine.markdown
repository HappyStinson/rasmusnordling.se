<blockquote>We're a machine built to run - and the machine never wears out. Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are. - Dennis Bramble</blockquote>



While reading the book [_Born to Run_](http://www.chrismcdougall.com/born-to-run/) I pictured myself as Caballo Blanco (the white horse). A true limitless inspiration, yet made of flesh and bone like everyone else.

My big fitness goal/challenge this year is to complete my very first marathon. I expect it to (and of course it will) be the best day of my life so far. <!-- more -->

It's still over 100 days left of PPP (practice, preparation, protein).

Another exciting thing is that I applied for the ASICS FrontRunner Swedish team. It's an opportunity to be an ambassador and represent ASICS in different races. You also get to try out products before everyone else and promote the ASICS brand.

My current race calendar for 2017:




    
  * Arena Run - February 18

    
  * Stockholm Tunnel Run Citybanan - March 26

    
  * ASICS Premiärmilen - April 1

    
  * STHLM Trail Run - May 6

    
  * Milspåret - May 18

    
  * ASICS Stockholm marathon - June 3

    
  * STHLM 10 - June 15

    
  * Stockholm Halvmarathon - September 9

    
  * Lidingöloppet 30 - September 23

    
  * Hässelbyloppet - October 8



I am just getting started on this journey and in 2018 I'll climb the ladder even [HIGHER](https://order.ensvenskklassiker.se/paket/paket_esk.php)! Why be stuck on the ground when you can fly in the sky?
