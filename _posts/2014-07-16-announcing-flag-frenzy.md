*This post was originally posted on my Swedish dev blog, happy kodar*.

Here comes another modest hej since I'm fired up again.

In this post I'm announcing my small game *Flag Frenzy*. <!--more-->

First of all, I just want to say that it's fun to write again. I appreciate every little like and appreciation that I'm getting. ðŸ™‚ It feeds my endorphin supply and feels like a virtual pat on the back. Although I don't want to get addicted and risk becoming a male version of [Kissie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissie). That is not how I imagined my future life to look like. ðŸ˜‰

However, I have some plans in progress that I'm revealing now!

Found a very interesting article a while ago by a guy who made [twelve games in a year](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/1gam-how-to-succeed-at-making-one-game-a-month-gamedev-3695).
Felt it gave me more inspiration and motivation since I didn't get into the game course in Stockholm (Game design at *Futuregames*) that I applied to.

I have to sit at home and code by myself instead.

Anyway, I will motivate myself to make one game a month and the hope is to get better all the time in the meantime, that is the whole idea behind the plan.
If you point your browser to [onegameamonth.com](https://onegameamonth.com/) you can see that this month's (July 2016) optional theme is flags. So I've figured out a little game about flags.

As July soon is over, my intention is to make a tiny game and finish on time.
I have imagined a simple button masher whit the aim of hoisting as many flags as possible for one minute to impress a girl.

With enough skill, she will fall in love and you can feel satisfied. Otherwise she gets angry and it's bye-bye.
Weather the game is about me or based on a real event has not been made official. You can read more from my [workbook](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0YAOyHaBJz7V2dQTnB4bU1RYWc&amp;usp=sharing) that I created just for this project.

Rasmus draft for Flag Frenzy.

Cute idea to hoist flags in the name of love.

Thanks for this time!
