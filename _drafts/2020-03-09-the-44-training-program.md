title: My experiences from doing the Zen Habits 44 Training Program
---
Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again... One of my Health & Fitness goals for 2020 is *I meditate most days of the week by the end of the year*. In this post I reflect on the benefits that meditation and mindfulness has given and continues to give me.<!--more-->

## What is the Zen Habits 44 Training Program?

*The 44 Training Program: Turning Uncertainty & Discomfort into Mindful Openness* is 11 short practices in mindfulness done for 44 days.

It‚Äôs 44-day video training program to get good at mindfulness, uncertainty and discomfort. It is a 44-day training program, where you commit to practicing for just 5-10 minutes a day. You‚Äôll get good at uncertainty and discomfort and change, and learn to find joy and openness in the midst of it all.

[The 44 Training Program Contents](https://zenhabits.net/44-toc/) has the complete program with links to each individual practice.

Before starting the first practice Leo talks about the importance of understanding the motivation behind doing 

[Preliminary Contemplation](https://zenhabits.net/44-preliminary/)

> If you only take away one thing from this post. Consider some contemplation on the Preciousness of Life, the Briefness of Life, the Inevitability of Suffering, and the Awesome Power of our Actions

So the four contemplations are:

The preciousness of life
The briefness of life
The inevitability of suffering
The awesome power of our actions

Before we start training with the Practices, I‚Äôd like you to take a couple days to reflect on a few things ‚Ä¶ to motivate ourselves to take this practice seriously and stick with it.

We‚Äôre motivating ourselves to begin again ‚Ä¶ because we‚Äôre always just beginning again, in each moment, after each screw-up, with fresh eyes.

I ask that you simply take a couple minutes to contemplate these things as I shared in the video ‚Ä¶ today and tomorrow, and preferably for a few moments at the start of each of your 44 Training sessions.

## First attempt

Between x of x and x of x I tried the program for the first time.
What where my results?

## Second attempt

Between 22nd of January and 9th of March I have been doing the practice all over again. This time with more preparation and motivation.

I did 20 days of guided meditation with Tanja Dyredand after founding her [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1rmK9MxfuFzoRrvBMxA0B0d4DBrs65WZ) on the topic on *doing nothing*. After my morning shower I sat naked on the carpeted floor, feeling the breeze from the ceiling fan. One of the ads that showed up on YouTube was for a meditation app called [Synctuition](https://synctuition.com/). I usually just skip ads immediately but here I was captivated for four minutes. I tried for free the first week then decided to pay for premium. I mostly have been listening to this late at night as I fall asleep. Maybe this deserves a post on its own.

After those initial twenty days, I decided to *begin again* with the 44 Training Program from Zen Habits.

I put in all the practices in [Todoist](https://todoist.com) to be reminded on the correct day.

P√• vilket s√§tt har jag m√§rkt skillnad?

For those who know me.. health important... meditation... benefits...

I have been using the iOS app [Oak - Meditation & Breathing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691) to track my unguided meditations. During this program I've meditated x hours and reach the x badge. Borde bli 33 dagar?

### Preliminary Practice...

vad inneb√§r det f√∂r mig - g√• upp tidigare, uts√§tta mina sinnen f√∂r nya upplevelser, vara tacksam f√∂r med och motg√•ngar, trevlig och sn√§ll mot andra...

### Days 1-4 and [Breath Meditation](https://zenhabits.net/44-practice-1/)

Focusing on the quality of my breath as it enters and leaves through the nose. Followed it all the way down to the stomach as it passed the lungs.

> If you have time to breathe you have time to meditate. You breathe when you walk. You breathe when you stand. You breathe when you lie down. ‚Äî Ajahn Amaro

### Days 5-8 and the [Body Scan](https://zenhabits.net/practice-2-body-scan/)

Hur k√§ndes det h√§r? Skrev jag n√•got i dagboken? Gick v√§l relativt bra, f√∂rsta dagen guidad sen 3 dagar med Oak 10 minuter. Sv√•rt att k√§nna specifika saker. Lite ont i anklarna m.m. och fl√§kten som bl√•ser p√• kroppen.

### Days 9-12 with [Curiosity & Welcoming](https://zenhabits.net/practice-3-curiosity/)

First day: Too tired to sit in my regular position, so I laid in bed on my back and fell asleep? Listened to the instructions again.

Second day: Same thing the second day... Not feeling anything in particular.

Third day: Sat in my usual spot. Focused in on a sore throat. Said Welcome. Again with guidance from the video.

Fourth day: Sat in my usual spot, focusing in on my hungry belly.

### Days 13-16 and [Dropping from Stories to the Body](https://zenhabits.net/practice-4-dropping-stories/)

The practice is to notice the stories that we‚Äôre telling ourselves, and drop into the body.

First day: Read the instructions and watched the video. I felt an itch on my right cheek but let it be. I focused on the quality of my breath as it went in and out through the nose. My stories today were on unfinished projects that I want to get done before trimester two at uni starts. Another story was that focusing on the breath is quite boring. I just let go of the thoughts and refocused.

Second day: Was a bit busier with thoughts flying around as I tried to focus on my breath. I had the song [Lord's Prayer by Hillsong Worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCxqjEz5hJ4) on my mind. My mind was reminding me of urgent tasks to get done this final week as I'm preparing myself for a second trimester at uni and also moving to a new place. The heavy traffic outside bothered me a bit and it was harder to concentrate (ideally you want to meditate in a quite space). My mind also had me excited over my plans for the summer in Sweden.

Third day: I noticed a slight pain on the left side of the chest. It disappeared as I straightened and relaxed my body. I briefly felt an itch around my right eye and towards the end of the 10 minutes, which felt unusually long, I felt some strain on my neck.

Fourth day: Sat on a folded towel instead of pillows. Mind wandered a bit, mostly about things to come. My way of getting back to the present is by returning to my breath. The stories tend to resolve around me and not other people. I'm afraid that you think I'm uninteresting and that you won't take time out of your day to read my posts. Heck, maybe you're not reading this? ü§î
Another story I told myself is that I'm a creative person who starts a lot of new projects but I suck at finishing them which leads to more stress and a busy mind that reminds me to clear some of the backlog. Physical sensations I felt was water from my eyes, as I yawned a tear slowly moved it's way down my right cheek.

### Days 17-20 and [Train in Uncertainty](https://zenhabits.net/practice-5-uncertainty/)

According to Leo, this is one of the key practices of the training. It's about embracing uncertainty and welcoming it, instead of running away or procrastinating etc. It's a big one for me and I have a lot of uncertainty because I don't like to be or do "wrong". I often move on to easier tasks if I get stuck and don't know how to proceed. I also spend a lot of extra time and energy on "research" to calm my mind and minimize any risk of failure.

First day: Uncertain about my first week in the new trimester. What will my guitar teacher say about my progress (or lack of)? Will I have enough time to rehearse and also prepare for a move to a new place? Is this post growing to long and should be split into several?
For all these uncertainties I tried to feel any physical discomfort but I couldn't really pinpoint any.

Second day: I had uncertainties about wether I stretch enough after my running. I feel some discomfort in my knees but perhaps I shouldn't worry. Also I have been having thoughts about what swim gear to buy. Hard to decide when there are so many options. I think I'll at least buy a pair of [Neoprene Swim Shorts](https://trigearlab.com/neoprene-swim-shorts/).  
The only real discomfort I could feel when thinking about these things was some pain in the chest.

Third day: Tried to bring out any discomfort or fears by thinking of projects and conversations I have been procrastinating on regarding my move to a new accommodation this weekend. Couldn't really feel anything. Only some tightness in the body and right knee.

Fourth day: I had a bust mind this morning with a lot of thoughts. I tried to think of something scary or uncomfortable but I'm struggling to feel any discomfort.

### Days 21-24 with [Open Awareness](https://zenhabits.net/practice-6-open/)

This practice is about relaxing into the present moment and accept whatever sensations you can feel. Then open up your senses and focus on the world around you.

First day: I was breathing with one nostril as I have a cold at the moment. Also felt a slight headache. In front of me I could here Leo's voice and some hissing from the video, as he guided me through this practice. I felt how my legs were touching the carpet. My gaze were resting on the red bed cover and textures in the room are rather soft.
To the left came noises from the traffic outside and my sight picked up on the cold and hard, black guitar amp by the bedside.
I didn't hear any specific sounds coming from the right, but it was hard to block out the traffic noise.
Behind me was just a wall and I felt air against my lower back.

Second day: Sat in an other direction and faced the window. Sounds in front of me was the traffic but also some fan noise from the laptop and what I believe is insects. I felt my ankle pressing down to the floor. I saw the hard and cold laptop and amp. To the left was the soft bed and to the right was the white sliding doors to the wardrobe/closet. Behind me was the void of the room and then the opposite wall with the door. I could feel a gentle breeze on my back and also how my lower back supported my upper body to sit straight.

Third day: Last time in this room so I sat in a new direction again. I relaxed in to the moment and could feel how my cold had gotten better.
In front of me was the bed with the computer and phone. I heard the cave water streaming from the Oak app and I felt how my left foot slowly slipped from it's position and was drawn towards the floor.
To the right was the window which let some light into the room. A bird outside was communicating as traffic drove by. Behind me was the white closet/wardrobe doors and I couldn't hear anything in particular from that direction. Again I could feel a light breeze when concentrating.
To the left was the rest of the room but I didn't really hear or feel anything special.
I finished everything with 15 instructed breaths from the Oak app (and then my stretch).

## Conclusion

Meditation and mindfulness has given me benefits. Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again.
