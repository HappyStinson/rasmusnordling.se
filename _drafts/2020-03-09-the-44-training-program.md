title: My experiences from doing the Zen Habits 44 Training Program
---
Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again... One of my Health & Fitness goals for 2020 is *I meditate most days of the week by the end of the year*. In this post I reflect on the benefits that meditation and mindfulness has given and continues to give me.<!--more-->

## What is the Zen Habits 44 Training Program?

*The 44 Training Program: Turning Uncertainty & Discomfort into Mindful Openness* is 11 short practices in mindfulness done for 44 days.

It‚Äôs 44-day video training program to get good at mindfulness, uncertainty and discomfort. It is a 44-day training program, where you commit to practicing for just 5-10 minutes a day. You‚Äôll get good at uncertainty and discomfort and change, and learn to find joy and openness in the midst of it all.

[The 44 Training Program Contents](https://zenhabits.net/44-toc/) has the complete program with links to each individual practice.

Before starting the first practice Leo talks about the importance of understanding the motivation behind doing 

[Preliminary Contemplation](https://zenhabits.net/44-preliminary/)

> If you only take away one thing from this post. Consider some contemplation on the Preciousness of Life, the Briefness of Life, the Inevitability of Suffering, and the Awesome Power of our Actions

So the four contemplations are:

The preciousness of life
The briefness of life
The inevitability of suffering
The awesome power of our actions

Before we start training with the Practices, I‚Äôd like you to take a couple days to reflect on a few things ‚Ä¶ to motivate ourselves to take this practice seriously and stick with it.

We‚Äôre motivating ourselves to begin again ‚Ä¶ because we‚Äôre always just beginning again, in each moment, after each screw-up, with fresh eyes.

I ask that you simply take a couple minutes to contemplate these things as I shared in the video ‚Ä¶ today and tomorrow, and preferably for a few moments at the start of each of your 44 Training sessions.

## First attempt

Between x of x and x of x I tried the program for the first time.
What where my results?

## Second attempt

Between 22nd of January and 9th of March I have been doing the practice all over again. This time with more preparation and motivation.

I did 20 days of guided meditation with Tanja Dyredand after founding her [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1rmK9MxfuFzoRrvBMxA0B0d4DBrs65WZ) on the topic on *doing nothing*. After my morning shower I sat naked on the carpeted floor, feeling the breeze from the ceiling fan. One of the ads that showed up on YouTube was for a meditation app called [Synctuition](https://synctuition.com/). I usually just skip ads immediately but here I was captivated for four minutes. I tried for free the first week then decided to pay for premium. I mostly have been listening to this late at night as I fall asleep. Maybe this deserves a post on its own.

After those initial twenty days, I decided to *begin again* with the 44 Training Program from Zen Habits.

I put in all the practices in [Todoist](https://todoist.com) to be reminded on the correct day.

P√• vilket s√§tt har jag m√§rkt skillnad?

For those who know me.. health important... meditation... benefits...

I have been using the iOS app [Oak - Meditation & Breathing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691) to track my unguided meditations. During this program I've meditated x hours and reach the x badge. Borde bli 33 dagar?

### Preliminary Practice...

vad inneb√§r det f√∂r mig - g√• upp tidigare, uts√§tta mina sinnen f√∂r nya upplevelser, vara tacksam f√∂r med och motg√•ngar, trevlig och sn√§ll mot andra...

### Days 1-4 and Breath Meditation

Focusing on the quality of my breath as it enters and leaves through the nose. Followed it all the way down to the stomach as it passed the lungs.

> If you have time to breathe you have time to meditate. You breathe when you walk. You breathe when you stand. You breathe when you lie down. ‚Äî Ajahn Amaro

### Days 5-8 and the Body Scan

Hur k√§ndes det h√§r? Skrev jag n√•got i dagboken? Gick v√§l relativt bra, f√∂rsta dagen guidad sen 3 dagar med Oak 10 minuter. Sv√•rt att k√§nna specifika saker. Lite ont i anklarna m.m. och fl√§kten som bl√•ser p√• kroppen.

Days 9-12 with Curiosity & Welcoming... First day too tired to sit in my regular position, so I laid in bed on my back and fell asleep? Listened to the instructions again. Same thing the second day... Not feeling anything in particular. Third day, sat in my usual spot. Focused in on a sore throat. Said Welcome. Again with guidance from the video. Last day, sat in my usual spot, focusing in on my hungry belly...

### Days 13-16 and [Dropping from Stories to the Body](https://zenhabits.net/practice-4-dropping-stories/)

The practice is to notice the stories that we‚Äôre telling ourselves, and drop into the body.

First day, read the instructions and watched the video. I felt an itch on my right cheek but let it be. I focused on the quality of my breath as it went in and out through the nose. My stories today were on unfinished projects that I want to get done before trimester two at uni starts. Another story was that focusing on the breath is quite boring. I just let go of the thoughts and refocused.
Second day was a bit busier with thoughts flying around as I tried to focus on my breath. I had the song [Lord's Prayer by Hillsong Worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCxqjEz5hJ4) on my mind. My mind was reminding me of urgent tasks to get done this final week as I'm preparing myself for a second trimester at uni and also moving to a new place. The heavy traffic outside bothered me a bit and it was harder to concentrate (ideally you want to meditate in a quite space). My mind also had me excited over my plans for the summer in Sweden.
On the third day I noticed a slight pain on the left side of the chest. It disappeared as I straightened and relaxed my body. I briefly felt an itch around my right eye and towards the end of the 10 minutes, which felt unusually long, I felt some strain on my neck.

## Conclusion

Meditation and mindfulness has given me benefits. Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again.
