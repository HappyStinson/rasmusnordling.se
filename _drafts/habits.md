## Purpose

Skriv ner dåliga och bra vanor

## Content

Funderade på om jag skulle skriva något på bloggen om mina vanor, eller mer om gapet. Sen läsa Power of Habit och dela kunskap jag lärt mig.

Dåliga vanor (som jag vill förändra): knäcker med fingrarna (cue?), biter på naglarna
Bra vanor: skriver dagbok, skriver ner mina tankar, weekly review, do it now istället för do it later

My week
Intermittent fasting on Mondays
24-hour fasting between Sunday - Monday dinner. Meaning I skip breakfast and lunch on Mondays. You can read more on intermittent fasting here… Got inspired by Jonas Colting, one of my role models. I have found several other resources recommending intermittent fasting for its health benefits. Among them Michael Mosley, famous for the 5:1 method. Instead of having a meal I usually go for a walk in the city/nature during lunchtime. A teaspoon of coconut oil in my morning tea helped in the beginning to (dämpa) the hunger. Now I just stick to plain tap water without much difficulty. Being hungry and “starving” doesn’t bother me that much anymore.

Top Gun Tuesday
T-shirt och lyssna på Top Gun soundtrack. Favorite track is Danger Zone. Obviously! Om det ändå var lika lätt att få in andra vanor/rutiner. 

Things I do daily
Track the time I spend doing certain recurring tasks. I use Toggl and start the timer before having a meal, going to the bathroom and emptying my inboxes such as e-mail and Todoist.
Board the train in the end closest to my stop. Tar en plats i tåget som är närmst uppgången där jag går av. Capture my thoughts in writing. Might be in a notepad or Todoist app. I keep it off my mind and safely stored until I’m ready to clarify and act on it.

Makers schedule, block off time in my calendar to work...

Exercise
Take long and shorter walks to kill time in between changing vehicles when commuting. (konstig mening).

Mindfulness
Meditation first thing in the morning…
Quick check in whenever I stand still at crossings.
Try to stress less and relax more often towards difficulties in life.

Some kind of Weekly Review (inte riktigt en vana ännu)

Journal to summarize the day before going to bed

Gratitude
I have started a habit where I write down the things during my day that I’m grateful for. According to psychological research (reference) this should increase happiness and well-being. Especially when comparing your situation to someone who has it worse.

Play guitar every day...

Vanor är nyckeln till ett rikare liv

Flourskölj efter lunch
Dålig morgonrutin
Ingen frukost - dåligt

Skulle vilja stretcha och skriva race report oftare efter träning och tävling. Löpskolning och styrketräning. 

Find a healthy habit that you want create. Do you want to write/code/create X hours every day? Or keep your to-do list organized and up-to-date?
Once you choose your habit, identify something you already do every day that you can attach your new healthy habit to. Ask yourself what the triggers are for that activity, then graft your new habit to the same event.
For example, if you find yourself procrastinating on writing every day, start sitting down to write for 30 minutes as soon as you’ve made your morning cup of coffee. If you tend to let your tasks pile up in your to-do list until they create more stress than relief, try making a habit of checking and re-organizing your tasks at the same times every day — after eating breakfast, before you break for lunch, and before you leave at the end of the day.
