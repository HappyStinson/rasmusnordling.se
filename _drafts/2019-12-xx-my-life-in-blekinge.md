title: My Life in Blekinge (2010-2016) - Decade Review part 1
---
Hello from a warm Brisbane! We are about to enter another year but also a new decade. I would like to take this opportunity and review my past ten years and share some of it in this post. This decade has been very fun and varied, yet demanding at the same time.  
In this first part I will take you through the first half of 2010s where I spent most my time in Blekinge.<!--more-->

## My Life in Blekinge (2010-2016)

### "Studying"

Doing this review feels a bit like a CV, and in actuality it is.

Back in early 2010 I lived in Ronneby, Blekinge and studied Game Programming at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). For those not familiar with Swedish geography, Ronneby is ca 385 km from Stockholm.

This was my first time living by myself and away from the family. I didn't bring a computer, which my neighbor Christopher thought was funny since we were going to study programming. He lent me one of his desktop computers and taught me the basics in Linux.

Since the Ronneby Campus was closing, me, my friends, and girlfriend at the time moved to the Minerva apartments in Karlskrona.
When the campus in Ronneby closed, the two organisations 6& (Ronneby [Sexmästeri](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexm%C3%A4steri)) and 6:- (Carlskrona Sexmästeri) would merge and a group of sixteen handpicked students were assigned the task to form a new organisation. Myself along with my fifteen friends came up with the name [Sexistenz](http://sexistenz.bthstudent.se/). It's the group responsible for organizing events for the fellow students. The most important mission of the year is the Introduction Week. We were listening to [Narcotic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ7E40Ec5ec) and [Electric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl_5NHTvDAI) on repeat the whole week while doing all sorts of fun and crazy stuff.
Sexistenz is tied to the students' union I suppose. We made decisions on how to look, what traditions to keep and what new ones to create. We all had different skillsets and I was SpexMästare, which I guess meant my skillset included being creative, spontaneous, and make people have a good time. In reality I helped the others with all kinds of work and managed to get some sponsorship from local companies.

In the summer I was back home visiting my family and met a funny photographer/musician named Mathias Andersson. We shared a couple of drinks and he was kind enough to take pictures of me.
You can see more of his photos on [his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MathiasAPhotography/).

In October 2010 I turned 20 and took my first of many trips to the liquor store, Systembolaget.

After handing down the responsibilities to the next generation of Sexistenz, I was able to join other groups and got approached by the "quasi" (in lack of a better word) [Kååtha Kamrater](https://kaatha-kamrater.se/). I really enjoyed their company and got inducted along with "Molle", "Smulan" and "Lill-Rauken", all from Sexistenz, to get my own camo vest. We have many good memories together. Some nights were even to good to remember.

When we weren't in Blekinge we would take trips to other Swedish cities such as Kalmar (SPIIK Bandy), Halmstad (Hjärtslaget) and Visby (Absolut Gotland). I was also in Denmark's capital Copenhagen a couple of times to visit the the Carlsberg museum (Øhlreise).

After Minerva I moved to Annebo with Christopher and Mikael Sundström, both classmates of mine. When they both got employed in Stockholm, I moved in with my best friend Robin instead.
After a while he moved out and I lived by myself until March 2016 when I moved back to Stockholm.

Emil S ... värt att nämna? Kanske bara lite kort...

In 2012 I travelled to USA with my friend Emil A to visit New York, Washington D.C, and the [Orion Music + More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Music_%2B_More) festival in Atlantic City.



During this time I was a full-time student until 2012 when the expected graduation would have been. I still had a couple of courses and exams to pass before I could get my degree.
Worked part-time at Student IT Helpdesk at BTH between 2011 and 2013.

distance course in web development in PHP...

Back in 2013 I had long hair that I don't even remember having 😂.

### "Working"

My first full-time position was as an IT Support Technician at Wise IT. I was providing user support of an application for the Swedish Coast Guard. Later I would join CGI and split my responsibilities between one part support (which turned into more Service Desk work), and one part back-end web development in C# and ASP.NET.  
During my time at CGI I also did a shorter gig helping another government agency (National Board of Housing, Building and Planning). This time with the front-end in JavaScript (AngularJS).

## Conclusion

This is the first part of my decade review. The next posts in the series are Second Time in Stockholm (2016-2019) and Moving to Brisbane, Australia (2019).

Hope you got something out of skimming through these posts. I sure got many chuckles traveling down memory lane.
