# Roslagsvåren 2018

Motivera andra till motion. Cykling är verkligen för alla.

Yesterday was one of those days I got to experience something new and unfamiliar.
Running and taking part in different races has become second nature to me.

This post is part of the series about my journey to exercise all year round and hopefully do the Swedish Classic Circuit...

I don't know if this classifies as a race report but I just want to share some thoughts from my first long-distance bike ride.

# Preparations
Ever since I did a failed attempt at this years Vasaloppet in late February my focus has been on refocusing on Vätternrundan.
In the middle of June I will cycle 300 km around Vättern, Sweden's next largest lake. Up until yesterday I only had done a few mil/miles of road cycling.

Roslagsvåren which is organised by the club Fredrikshof CK.
There were two distances to choose from. The shorter being 72 km and the longer run was twice as much.

Due to bad planning I had to buy bicycle pants and shoes the day before the race.
I'm pleased with the Scott ... pants 
But unfortunately the shoes wasn't compatible with the SPD-pedals. This would result in more hassle later on.

I realised this to late and had to resort  an incompatible cleat with the so I couldn't lock them in the pedal

Read up on the basics of group cycling.

Bicycle fair in Kista where I met Fredrikshof CK ...
Thanks to Markko at Doctrin for giving me the tip about Roslagsvåren.

# Race Day
Regular breakfast + a few deciliters of beet juice

Collecting the bib
Getting help changing the pedals to ones with toe-basket (kolla upp termen)
Sign-up to ride with the slowest master group possible, 

My shoes were very slippery...




The race began at 9:30 and the faster master groups and riders taking the shorter circuit got away first.

Security walkthrough before the start. I think we were 15 participants with Magnus and Anette from Fredrikshof as the leaders riding in the red group.
It was a mix of women and men in varying ages, me being among the youngest and most inexperienced since I was the only one with no prio experience riding in a group.



At 10:xx our group went away, I believe last of the last.

Had trouble fitting my feet inside the pedals and forgot to start the tracking on my watch.

The different stops

Cinnamon bun, saft(lemonade?)
Chocolate ball, sports drink very weak

I think it was just before the stop at Brottby when a lone cyclist with an aerodynamically shaped helmet riding in a tempo-position drove by the whole group in a matter of seconds.

Brottby Hot dog, Powerade
Mixed candy + more saft

Also water from my bottles whenever we stopped in between the depos(?)...

Two-pairs most of the time
One pair on trickier parts with a lot of hills, turns and narrow road.



Finish at 17:xx ? with a total time of ...

Time	6:54:53
Behind (category)	
Pace (min/km)	3:04
Speed (km/h)	19.53
Starttime	10:12:38


# Aftermath

I got emotional near the end and I was close to tearing up.
My goal was just to get around the whole circuit and I'm very proud of what I achieved.
