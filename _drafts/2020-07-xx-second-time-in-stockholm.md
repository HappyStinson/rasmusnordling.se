title: Second Time in Stockholm (2016-2019) - Decade Review part 2
---
Hello from a warm Brisbane! We are about to enter another year but also a new decade. I would like to take this opportunity and review my past ten years and share some of it in this post. This decade has been very fun and varied, yet demanding at the same time.  
In this second part I will talk about my life after my return home, to Stockholm.<!--more-->

If you don't know me that well or want to know what my latest adventure is, you can check out the page [about Dream BIG and Rasmus](/about).

To read about my life between 2010-2016 which leads into this post, head on over to [My Life in Blekinge (2010-2016)]({% post_url 2019-12-31-my-life-in-blekinge %}).

## Second Time in Stockholm (2016-2019)

I moved back to my parents in March 2016 after six and a half years in Blekinge.

I kept working as an IT consultant and spent the first six months with Academic Work Technology helping a client within FinTech (Financial Technology).
When that assignment ended I had to do the usual job seeking process of updating my CV, writing cover letters and going to interviews. Coaches at Manpower reviewed my documents and I got a lot of valuable information on how to set Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely (SMART) goals.

My dad saw an ad about Lexicon and their continuation course in ASP.NET MVC 5, which seemed like a good match since I was familiar with the technologies already from my time with CGI.
During the time at Lexicon I met Per and Atanas and we spent many hours watching Scott Allen's videos on [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).  
We were tasked to write a terminal dungeon crawler to learn the basics in C# and then for the final assignment we did a simple Learning Management System. Feel free to browse the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HappyStinson/lexicon-lms). During the breaks I squeezed in some time to play Space Invaders.

A teacher at Lexicon showed us an ad on [Uptrail](https://www.uptrail.com/) where [tretton37](https://tretton37.com/) were looking for their next ninja. I applied and started working for them in the easter of 2017.

PICTURE HERE!!??! Nån bild?

### My time with tretton37

My time with tretton37 included five different assignments and I worked in-house, at the client's office and also from home. I was employed as a .NET Ninja, mainly focusing on back-end Web Development in .NET and C#.

The first two assignments was in-house at the office on Kungsgatan. The first one was helping a retailer of appliances with a web shop in [Umbraco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbraco).  
I then helped out with developing a new mobile app for a gym chain. I was developing parts of the API. We had a great team distributed among the offices and Jonas L worked his magic as the Project Leader. Our Australian configuration manager Nathan (at one point looking like a pirate) became one of my better friends at the company.

For my third assignment I worked from Sturegatan on a new and exciting (may I say revolutionary?) product in the Health Tech sector. The client had a mixture of doctors, developers and AI experts working together in teams to give better healthcare to the world. I joined the back-end team to further expand the product towards using the [Starcounter database](https://starcounter.io/).

After that me and fellow ninja Magnus updated the migration tool for Platina (a document and diary system). The mapping of data between the different versions of the databases was mostly done with Views in SQL. We then had to update the tool to use functionality found in the Platina Core API.  
At this time I was thinking about my next stage in the career and while I was ready to resign a new assignment appeared.

Lastly I was back where It all started (almost), at a government agency. This is the time where I got to discover Sundbyberg for the first time, which was cool. The team was the biggest yet with many consultants and dedicated testers (yes plural)!

It was with mixed feelings that I left this assignment because I was really getting a grip on the domain and the business logic. I really enjoyed the company of everyone in the team, not only the colleagues working from "Sumpan". This assignment also gave me valuable experience of working in a remote team, and the team probably holds the record of amounts of After Works/Beers 🕺🍺 in relation to amount of [Clean Code](https://www.wordnik.com/words/clean%20code) written.  
Oh and before I forget, I did say we programmed in Swedish right?

I've been very fortunate to work for tretton37 and even though every new assignment was located further away from home, they also challenged me in new ways and I have really enjoyed working and socializing with everyone of you that I met along the way.

Also at my time with tretton37 I went to three Knowabungas (knowledge conference) in Berlin, Riga and Prague, and their developer conference [Leetspeak](https://leetspeak.se) twice.

It's a company with very passionated people and part of the reason why I decided to leave is that my passion for writing code faded with time. I just couldn't see myself standing at a similar desk staring at a monitor until my retirement.

Moving to tretton37 also meant I would transition into the world of [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and upon leaving, I bought my work tools, the heavily stickerized MacBook Pro, and iPhone that I had fallen in love with.

### .NET Ninja -> Musician

For a short period of time I was considering becoming a "Digital Nomad" and combine me interest for traveling the world and working remote.

Found the portal Nomad List... link

I was very determined to leave Sweden and go to Australia before I turned 30. I later decided that I wanted to study [Songwriting at JMC Academy](https://www.jmcacademy.edu.au/courses/songwriting) which meant a combination of my dreams of moving to Australia and also to work in the music industry.  
My first contact with JMC was early 2017 so the thought of pursuing my passion for music has been on my mind for some time.

Skriva här lite kort om Nathan och Peter från Doctrin och alla andra som inspirerat mig att följa mitt hjärta och uppnå mina mål och drömmar? Ja det blir nog bättre än att ha det i nästa del.
Sen kan jag inleda nästa del med att referera tillbaka hit.

Application process...

my feedback, blueberry meetup with Peter Gainey and the other Swedes.

Help from Mathias

PICTURE !? Vet inte om jag ska ha en bild här eller spara de till del 3.... kanske har fler länka till Vimeo, kan man baka in direkt i sidan?
Fast det här inlägget känns jävligt långt. Bättre att skriva mer i del 3 tror jag.

### Recreation

So what did I do when I wasn't working?

I did a lot of personal development in these years.

I've been to several open lectures since the start with Balansekonomi in 2016. Some gave me insights on financial growth, passive income, choosing your friends, realizing your potential, and success in general. One of my favourites were Jonas Colting (Swedish triathlete and my role model) talking for over 3 hours about how living healthy isn't always "fun" and "tasty".  
Often when you go to these kind of life changing events (in my perspective) you leave with a huge boost of inspiration. After this lecture with Jonas, I changed my diet to be more Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) in combination with intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast and lunch) every Monday, pretty much until September 2019.

PICTURE? Typ lite mat eller något?

Started the first version of this blog on WordPress and wrote my [first post]({% post_url 2016-10-27-private-eye %}). Since then I have migrated over to Jekyll and now all I do is write in markdown and push to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HappyStinson/rasmusnordling.se).

My political engagement and volunteering: 


Vi Som Inte Röker (VISIR), Tobakspodden, Almedalen, Tobacco Endgame: I have been somewhat active spreading information about Tobacco Endgame and the dangers with tobacco on Facebook, through email and a letter to the editor that got published in Metro. It's a good cause and I will continue to help the organizations and the Swedish government to reach the target of a non smoking Sweden by the year 2025. I became a member of VISIR and helping them realize their goals.
- **Keep Sweden Clean:** I have been randomly picking litter as I took my walks around Stockholm. I encourage more people to care for the environment and to support _Håll Sverige Rent_.
- **TTIP:** Went to my first demonstration which was against Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).
Gratislunchen, Peak Oil...
**Volunteering:** Was board secretary for VISIR Stockholm/Uppsala between January to September.
I didn’t really handle all the extra work very well and I put a lot of hours and energy into something I later had to drop because of a frustration that wasn’t aligning with what I wanted with my life.
I still plan to engage in activities to reach the goal of a tobacco free society some day with year 2025 being the closest target.
As an own side project I bought the domain *tobakspodden.se* to be used for a podcast that didn’t really take off and is still In the initial planning phase.
**Political and Sustainable Development:** Spending several days in Almedalen visiting my sister and engaging in political discussions was the **highlight of 2017**. Some of the other political events I've been to include:

- Tobacco Endgame/Global Development seminars that I mentioned [in this post](/2017/05/19/weekly-news/)
- Public seminars about NATO- among the organizers was Vänsterpartiet (Left party)
- Stockholm Act, Global Bar and a concert with José Gonzalez
- People's Climate March Stockholm – Together for a Sustainable Future!

Global Goals... still where the pin on my back pack.

FN:s globala mål för en hållbar värld.

Began purchasing trees via [Better Globe](https://en.betterglobe.com/) and will by the end of 2020 own 339. Those trees will help to bind xxx CO2. Also opened a savings account in Avanza bank and bought my first stocks in [Jetty AB](https://jetty.se/), [Estea Sverigefastigheter 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRTHSnWeRi0) and [LunchIn&trade;](https://www.fundedbyme.com/en/campaign/8301/lunchin-networks-ab/).

Fun with friends, co-workers, and family:

I've been to several [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/) and events. Some of my favourites include [Stockholm Musicians & Music Education](https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Musicians-Meetup/), [Personlig produktivitet och GTD](https://www.meetup.com/gtdstockholm/), [Code Night from IDG](https://www.idg.se/2.37707/code-night), [Foo Café](https://foocafe.org/), [Coding After Work](https://www.meetup.com/CodingAfterWork/) (where I did some hacking on this project) and a couple of [networking lunches](https://lunchintra.net/).

I've also done a few different Escape Rooms...

Travelled once more to Copenhagen in 2016 and 2017 to do the Nordic Game Jam (NGJ). If you want to know more, then go to the [post]({% post_url 2016-04-20-nordic-game-jam-2016-post-mortem %}) from NGJ 2016 or look at [What's There?](https://rasmusnordling.itch.io/whats-there) from NGJ 2017.

Slowly
Jelena och Sepher, kolla mitt utkast om Slowly ifall jag skrivit mer. Men räcker med någon mening. Caro att vi träffades 1? gång.



I did several attempts to stop biting my fingernails. But it’s not been a habit that I could keep permanently. Longest streak according to my journal was 96 days from January 24 to April 30. Oh well, up on the horse again with a new strategy.

During the years since I read Getting Things Done, I've tried several to-do list apps such as Wunderlist, Moo.do, Nirvana and Zenkit. I have both been very productive and achieving my goals and at other times procrastinating and failing to track any progress. Now, all my tasks are in [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

### My Transformation From Couch Potato to Long-Distance Runner

Arguably the biggest change is my transformation from couch potato to long-distance runner (spoiler: didn't happen over night).

So what's so fun and exciting about exercising anyway?

When you exercise, your body releases endorphins – the “feel good hormone” – and these endorphins are able to provide a wide range of positive benefits as you go about your day.

In addition to releasing endorphins, regular exercise is able to boost your confidence by changing your body and showing you that you can hit your goals if you set your mind to them.

Of course, the physical benefits of exercise are definitely worthwhile as well.

When you exercise regularly, you’ll have more energy, more strength, and better health – all things which are able to translate to more success in both your personal and professional life.

Well for me... let go, endorphins, challenge myself to grow.

 + klassikern... och typ diverse lopp...(länk till dreams Health & Fitness?)

During my time at Emric, did two races with them that I recall, Finansloppet and Bellmanstaffeten and I joined the club Team Stockholm Marathon Running (TSM) to motivate me even further.

Led by Anders Szalkai who [won the Stockholm Marathon in 2001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sABllEIQOeM).

[races](/dreams/#health-fitness)

cardio...

Klassikern it builds character. You want to give up so bad but you push through because you know it will be worth it. The personal victory of overcoming limitations is greater than the pain that come and goes.

I did most of my races alone but would often meet Per from Lexicon or someone from Emric, TSM or SCT.

Vasaloppet

I have tried to ski Vasaloppet twice with the best attempt of coming 3x / 90 km in 2018. Bad preparations. Listened to the Swedish podcasts LK and Vasapodden.

Yoga with Atanas and also TSM a couple of times.
- *YOGATHON STHLM 2017* with the yogi Swami Jyothirmayah & Stockholm Culture Festival. Morning yoga in a rainy Kungsträdgården followed by lunch, ice cream, meditation and breathing exercise with my buddy [Atanas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atanas-f-nikolov/)

- **Became a _runner_:** I have previously been running on and off but when I joined TSM Running back in June a spark if you will got lit and I realized how much good comes from running. Since then I have raced several times and the best day was when I ran Lidingöloppet 15 km.

- Really proud of myself for doing the Swedish Classic. I've experienced both physical and mental growth this year.

Cyklade Lidingöloppet MTB 64 km. Det var kul men jobbigt. Pratade lite med Martin Stenmark och Peter Magnusson.

Cyklade Cykelvasan 90 på tiden 8:20:28. Hyrde en cykel på Skidmacken i Sälen. Det var en regnig och lång dag. Det jobbigaste jag gjort hittills.

Klassiker of Hope... 2018?

Other healthy habits

Make this a list instead?

Tried different routes to and from work and school such as running, cycling, and getting of at a different stop to get more exercise. Taking short walks during the lunch breaks. Got of the bus. Stopped taking elevators and only walk the stairs. Stop at red light and relax instead of hurrying over to the other side like everyone else does. Practiced letting go and stay more in the present moment instead of dwelling the (unchangeable) past or worrying about the (hypothetical) future.

List my Garmin stats for 2016-2019... Simningen har jag loggat separat? Kanske kolla kalender eller något.


**Running:** I would be a fool not to mention all my exercise as something that went well (part from an injury). Started running with adidas Runners thanks to Per Nordenbrink for recommending it. In December I replaced some of my running with Nordic walking (jogging with poles) to prepare for the upcoming skiing. New **Personal Best for 10K is 50:34** (MilSpåret).

**Running injury:** During one of my hill running workouts I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my calf which turned out to be an injury that meant I had to go to rehab training and miss a few workout sessions and races. I limbed for about a week but quickly recovered so the muscle probably wasn’t completely off.

- **Awaken the procrastinator:** A great frustration has been not getting things done and on time. By realizing this is a psychological behavior and doing some therapy exercises found in the book _Dance on deadline_, I am on my way to break this behavior and getting the right things done ahead of the deadline. **Therapy** skriv lite om det... 10 sessions, mindfulness and meditation

**Therapy:** Since September I’ve been seeing a therapist about my procrastination and fear of burning out. I have done a mixture of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Mindfulness exercises. We have touched on several topics to improve my life and more of this in an upcoming post perhaps.

Vet inte om jag kanske ska flytta upp detta... Viveka sa att första steget är att flytta hemifrån för att bli lyckligare, mer självständig och så vidare. Började kolla på lägenheter, lånelöfte men var inte redo att rota mig i stockholm så jag tar mina pengar till utbildningen istället.

Werlabs blood test with Atanas, verdict was.. lack of D-vitamin, perhaps less of an issue here in the [Sunshine State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland).

## Conclusion

There you have it. Did you make it all the way down here? In that case, thank you for taking time out of your day (or sleepless night) to read what I share 🙂.

This became by far my longest post yet, and it managed to escape the other friends collecting dust in the cozy drafts folder.

This is the second part of my decade review. Part 1 is called [My Life in Blekinge (2010-2016)]({% post_url 2019-12-31-my-life-in-blekinge %}) and the final part in the series is Moving to Brisbane, Australia (2019).

Hope you got something out of skimming through these posts. I sure got many chuckles traveling down memory lane.
