title: My experiences from doing the Zen Habits 44 Training Program
---
Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again... One of my Health & Fitness goals for 2020 is *I meditate most days of the week by the end of the year*. In this post I reflect on the benefits that meditation and mindfulness has given and continues to give me.<!--more-->

## What is the Zen Habits 44 Training Program?

*The 44 Training Program: Turning Uncertainty & Discomfort into Mindful Openness* is 11 short practices in mindfulness done for 44 days.

It’s 44-day video training program to get good at mindfulness, uncertainty and discomfort. It is a 44-day training program, where you commit to practicing for just 5-10 minutes a day. You’ll get good at uncertainty and discomfort and change, and learn to find joy and openness in the midst of it all.

If this appeals to you and want to ... Leo's [mission](https://zenhabits.net/mission/)

[The 44 Training Program Contents](https://zenhabits.net/44-toc/) has the complete program with links to each individual practice.

Before starting the first practice Leo talks about the importance of understanding the motivation behind doing 

[Preliminary Contemplation](https://zenhabits.net/44-preliminary/)

> If you only take away one thing from this post. Consider some contemplation on the Preciousness of Life, the Briefness of Life, the Inevitability of Suffering, and the Awesome Power of our Actions

So the four contemplations are:

The preciousness of life
The briefness of life
The inevitability of suffering
The awesome power of our actions

Before we start training with the Practices, I’d like you to take a couple days to reflect on a few things … to motivate ourselves to take this practice seriously and stick with it.

We’re motivating ourselves to begin again … because we’re always just beginning again, in each moment, after each screw-up, with fresh eyes.

I ask that you simply take a couple minutes to contemplate these things as I shared in the video … today and tomorrow, and preferably for a few moments at the start of each of your 44 Training sessions.

## First attempt

Between x of x and x of x I tried the program for the first time.
What where my results?

Used the app Mind Journey? paid for premium? and Mindfulness (in Swedish?).

## Second attempt

Between 22nd of January and 9th of March I have been doing the practice all over again. This time with more preparation and motivation.

I did 20 days of guided meditation with Tanja Dyredand after founding her [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1rmK9MxfuFzoRrvBMxA0B0d4DBrs65WZ) on the topic on *doing nothing*. After my morning shower I sat naked on the carpeted floor, feeling the breeze from the ceiling fan. One of the ads that showed up on YouTube was for a meditation app called [Synctuition](https://synctuition.com/). I usually just skip ads immediately but here I was captivated for four minutes. I tried for free the first week then decided to pay for premium. I mostly have been listening to this late at night as I fall asleep. Maybe this deserves a post on its own.

After those initial twenty days, I decided to *begin again* with the 44 Training Program from Zen Habits.

I put in all the practices in [Todoist](https://todoist.com) to be reminded on the correct day.

På vilket sätt har jag märkt skillnad?

For those who know me.. health important... meditation... benefits...

I have been using the iOS app [Oak - Meditation & Breathing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691) to track my unguided meditations. During this program I've meditated x hours and reach the x badge. Borde bli 33 dagar?

### Preliminary Practice...

vad innebär det för mig - gå upp tidigare, utsätta mina sinnen för nya upplevelser, vara tacksam för med och motgångar, trevlig och snäll mot andra...

### Days 1-4 and [Breath Meditation](https://zenhabits.net/44-practice-1/)

Focusing on the quality of my breath as it enters and leaves through the nose. Followed it all the way down to the stomach as it passed the lungs.

> If you have time to breathe you have time to meditate. You breathe when you walk. You breathe when you stand. You breathe when you lie down. — Ajahn Amaro

### Days 5-8 and the [Body Scan](https://zenhabits.net/practice-2-body-scan/)

Hur kändes det här? Skrev jag något i dagboken? Gick väl relativt bra, första dagen guidad sen 3 dagar med Oak 10 minuter. Svårt att känna specifika saker. Lite ont i anklarna m.m. och fläkten som blåser på kroppen.

### Days 9-12 with [Curiosity & Welcoming](https://zenhabits.net/practice-3-curiosity/)

First day: Too tired to sit in my regular position, so I laid in bed on my back and fell asleep? Listened to the instructions again.

Second day: Same thing the second day... Not feeling anything in particular.

Third day: Sat in my usual spot. Focused in on a sore throat. Said Welcome. Again with guidance from the video.

Fourth day: Sat in my usual spot, focusing in on my hungry belly.

### Days 13-16 and [Dropping from Stories to the Body](https://zenhabits.net/practice-4-dropping-stories/)

The practice is to notice the stories that we’re telling ourselves, and drop into the body.

First day: Read the instructions and watched the video. I felt an itch on my right cheek but let it be. I focused on the quality of my breath as it went in and out through the nose. My stories today were on unfinished projects that I want to get done before trimester two at uni starts. Another story was that focusing on the breath is quite boring. I just let go of the thoughts and refocused.

Second day: Was a bit busier with thoughts flying around as I tried to focus on my breath. I had the song [Lord's Prayer by Hillsong Worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCxqjEz5hJ4) on my mind. My mind was reminding me of urgent tasks to get done this final week as I'm preparing myself for a second trimester at uni and also moving to a new place. The heavy traffic outside bothered me a bit and it was harder to concentrate (ideally you want to meditate in a quite space). My mind also had me excited over my plans for the summer in Sweden.

Third day: I noticed a slight pain on the left side of the chest. It disappeared as I straightened and relaxed my body. I briefly felt an itch around my right eye and towards the end of the 10 minutes, which felt unusually long, I felt some strain on my neck.

Fourth day: Sat on a folded towel instead of pillows. Mind wandered a bit, mostly about things to come. My way of getting back to the present is by returning to my breath. The stories tend to resolve around me and not other people. I'm afraid that you think I'm uninteresting and that you won't take time out of your day to read my posts. Heck, maybe you're not reading this? 🤔
Another story I told myself is that I'm a creative person who starts a lot of new projects but I suck at finishing them which leads to more stress and a busy mind that reminds me to clear some of the backlog. Physical sensations I felt was water from my eyes, as I yawned a tear slowly moved it's way down my right cheek.

### Days 17-20 and [Train in Uncertainty](https://zenhabits.net/practice-5-uncertainty/)

According to Leo, this is one of the key practices of the training. It's about embracing uncertainty and welcoming it, instead of running away or procrastinating etc. It's a big one for me and I have a lot of uncertainty because I don't like to be or do "wrong". I often move on to easier tasks if I get stuck and don't know how to proceed. I also spend a lot of extra time and energy on "research" to calm my mind and minimize any risk of failure.

First day: Uncertain about my first week in the new trimester. What will my guitar teacher say about my progress (or lack of)? Will I have enough time to rehearse and also prepare for a move to a new place? Is this post growing to long and should be split into several?
For all these uncertainties I tried to feel any physical discomfort but I couldn't really pinpoint any.

Second day: I had uncertainties about wether I stretch enough after my running. I feel some discomfort in my knees but perhaps I shouldn't worry. Also I have been having thoughts about what swim gear to buy. Hard to decide when there are so many options. I think I'll at least buy a pair of [Neoprene Swim Shorts](https://trigearlab.com/neoprene-swim-shorts/).  
The only real discomfort I could feel when thinking about these things was some pain in the chest.

Third day: Tried to bring out any discomfort or fears by thinking of projects and conversations I have been procrastinating on regarding my move to a new accommodation this weekend. Couldn't really feel anything. Only some tightness in the body and right knee.

Fourth day: I had a bust mind this morning with a lot of thoughts. I tried to think of something scary or uncomfortable but I'm struggling to feel any discomfort.

### Days 21-24 with [Open Awareness](https://zenhabits.net/practice-6-open/)

This practice is about relaxing into the present moment and accept whatever sensations you can feel. Then open up your senses and focus on the world around you.

First day: I was breathing with one nostril as I have a cold at the moment. Also felt a slight headache. In front of me I could here Leo's voice and some hissing from the video, as he guided me through this practice. I felt how my legs were touching the carpet. My gaze were resting on the red bed cover and textures in the room are rather soft.
To the left came noises from the traffic outside and my sight picked up on the cold and hard, black guitar amp by the bedside.
I didn't hear any specific sounds coming from the right, but it was hard to block out the traffic noise.
Behind me was just a wall and I felt air against my lower back.

Second day: Sat in an other direction and faced the window. Sounds in front of me was the traffic but also some fan noise from the laptop and what I believe is insects. I felt my ankle pressing down to the floor. I saw the hard and cold laptop and amp. To the left was the soft bed and to the right was the white sliding doors to the wardrobe/closet. Behind me was the void of the room and then the opposite wall with the door. I could feel a gentle breeze on my back and also how my lower back supported my upper body to sit straight.

[![The 44 Training Program in Todoist](/assets/images/bedroom-on-fairfield-road.jpg)](/assets/images/bedroom-on-fairfield-road.jpg)

Third day: Last time in this room so I sat in a new direction again. I relaxed in to the moment and could feel how my cold had gotten better.
In front of me was the bed with the computer and phone. I heard the cave water streaming from the Oak app and I felt how my left foot slowly slipped from it's position and was drawn towards the floor.
To the right was the window which let some light into the room. A bird outside was communicating as traffic drove by. Behind me was the white closet/wardrobe doors and I couldn't hear anything in particular from that direction. Again I could feel a light breeze when concentrating.
To the left was the rest of the room but I didn't really hear or feel anything special.
I finished everything with 15 instructed breaths from the Oak app (and then my stretch).

Fourth day: I was relaxing on the floor when the morning alarm rang and interrupted me. Started again with a [10 minute Zen Meditation Timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHIc0DLSsoE) and relaxed into the present moment. Felt a migraine-like pain bbetween the eyes, caused by a cold. Since there's no point in resisting it I just said *welcome*. For the open awareness I scanned the room clockwise. Starting with was in front of me. I could see myself in the mirror, on a light blue door. Behind it was the white wall. To the right was the desk, bed, and a window. I heard some recurring sound that I think came from this direction. Behind me was another white wall and I could see my shadow being projected on it when looking in the mirror (cheating?). To the left was the turquoise door and my swim trunks. I heard the engaged wall-mounted fan from the common room.
I tried to pay attention to any air touching my body but it was hard to detect any.

### Days 25-28 with [Loving Kindness](https://zenhabits.net/practice-7-kindness/)

This practice is to send love and compassion, both to ourself and others. Repeat these whishes and genuinely try to feel something in your heart.

First say it to yourself (out loud or in your head about three times),
then say it to someone you love. Picture that person going through a hard time.
After that say it to someone you have neutral feelings towards (maybe a neighbour).
After that say it to someone who you have negative feelings like resentment or hatred towards.
After that say it to everyone in your immediate vicinity. Picture a group of people.
Lastly send this wishes out to all living beings.

May I be happy. May I be at peace. May I have an end to my difficulties / My I be free from stress.
May [someone I love] be happy...
May  be happy...
May all beings be happy...

First day: May I be happy. May Sofie be happy. (neutral feelings, vem?). May Kakan Hermansson be happy. May everyone in my Unit be happy. May all beings be happy.

Second day: May I be happy. May my mother be at peace. May Presto have an end to her difficulties. May Vinnie be free from stress. May everyone at Raymont be happy. May all beings be at peace.

Third day: Read the post on [Loving Kindness](https://zenhabits.net/44-kindness). May I be happy. May Robin be at peace. May Misty have an end to her difficulties. May Tim be free from stress. May everyone at JMC be happy. May all beings be at peace.

Fourth day: May I be happy. May Per be at peace. May Jack Hamilton have an end to his difficulties. May Georgia be free from stress. May everyone on Cadell Street be happy. May all beings be at peace.

### Days 29-32 and [Tonglen (sending & receiving)](https://zenhabits.net/practice-8-tonglen/)

This practice is... <https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-tonglen/> <https://zenfulspirit.com/2017/03/28/beginners-guide-tonglen-meditation/> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonglen>

First day: Followed along to the video. difficulty . Fear/anxiety of the upcoming sight-singing. Svårt att komma på någon som jag är sur/arg på.

Second day: Followed along to the video difficulty . Fear/anxiety of the upcoming sight-singing. Svårt att komma på någon som jag är sur/arg på.

Third day: Came off track for a few days. Followed along to the video difficulty . Fear/anxiety of the upcoming sight-singing. Svårt att komma på någon som jag är sur/arg på. Hard to stay focused. Mind wandered.

Fourth day: Followed along to the video difficulty . Fear/anxiety/uncertainty of the upcoming performance platform at Uni. Svårt att komma på någon som jag är sur/arg på.

### Days 33-36 with a [Tender Heart](https://zenhabits.net/practice-9-tenderheart/)

Long break between Tonglen and Tender Heart... Start up again on Monday 23 March.

This practice is...whenever we feel some sort of discomfort that's only an exterior consequence. Try to look beyond that and find the tenderness and love. Like a tight chest with discomfort. See whats behind that tightness.

First day: Felt a tightness in my right knee as I sat down in my position. Also a pressing feeling around the nose from a cold. Regards to the practice I couldn't really feel any discomfort or tenderness. My mind wandered a bit as I listened to Leo's instructions.

Second day: Thought of a smoker I passed yesterday. It was an older man smoking next to a boy. I had an urge to tell him about second hand smoking but I just walked by. I could still feel a bit of pressure from my sinusitis and even a short tightness in my chest. I paid more attention to the instructions and noticed things I missed yesterday.

Third day: Sat on a rolled up bed linen? More discomfort... Finished with box and awake breathing with the Oak-app.

Fourth day: Sat on a rolled up bed linen? More discomfort... Finished with box and awake breathing with the Oak-app. Could here Kyle playing music.

### Days 37-40 on the [Bodhisattva Path](https://zenhabits.net/practice-10-bodhisattva/)

This practice is... helping others. Help all beings. First help yourself. Financially stable, easier to be generous. Bodhisattva (a being who is trying to help all other beings). In a sense this blog post is exactly that. I'm helping myself by doing this program and sharing my experiences.

For this practice I changed my position to sit on the edge of the bed. This practice is a little different from the previous ones and I didn't do much except sitting straight with my eyes closed and paying attention to Leo's voice.
I had some connection issues and got distracted by voices outside, which made me feel excluded and a bit lonely again.
On the second day, I had some trouble staying present and my thoughts wandered in to the future. I had to bring my awareness back several times. Finally starting to feel better in my body after two weeks of being sick.
On the third day I would just lay in my bed sleepy and then lastly I sat up again for the final day.

### Days 41-44 to [Accept Everything](https://zenhabits.net/practice-11-everything/)

This practice is... not put labels on everything saying that is good/bad or i like/don't like a certain thing. Accept that moments don't come back and see everything around you as enlightenment.

First day: I have arrived at the last practice and must admit I've been having some days where I didn't do any mindfulness at all. I'm *way over* the intended 44 days that this program "should" take. I changed up my position (again) to sit at the edge of my desk chair with eyes closed, spine straight and tongue relaxed. I sat still for roughly 10 minutes while listening to the instruction video. It was hard relaxing the shoulders and I could feel a tightness in my spine as well. My focus wandered a bit as I thought about my upcoming day and then had a déjà vu moment when Leo mentioned a concept that felt very familiar. Hunger introduced itself but I didn't let that distract me.

Second day: I had another break from this meditation and came back to it on May 13. This time I sat on the edge of my desk chair, eyes closed and hands resting in my lap. I felt a stiffness in my shoulders. I was listening to Leo's voice and being interrupted by thoughts, mostly related to future events. I would rather just take a walk, listen to podcasts and eat chocolate than to exercise. I turned my attention back to Leo as he was talking about the world and all impressions during a day, in terms of enlightenment and painting of a mandala.
After the video I set a timer for five minutes to just contemplate. My neighbor [Thomas](https://fernbrothers.com/) was drumming in the music room underneath and I had more thoughts about the future.

Third day: I have drifted away from my morning routine and did todays meditation little after 10 in the evening. Same posture and setting as yesterday. There is still a lot of thoughts that pop up. I would imagine the whole world is pretty much thinking about the future right now. Even though its "better" to be present.

Fourth day:

Vill jag ha med någon bild? Kanske räcker med några citat?

> Any action done with awareness is meditation. Meditation means to be fully aware of our actions, thoughts, feelings and emotions. - Unknown

citatet från kung fu

citat från oak

även citera mig själv? typ viktiga meningar så att man får en överblick?

The original sign up-link seems broken but if you got inspired to try this then [start here](https://zenhabits.net/44-welcome/) and then work your way through [The 44 Training Program Contents](https://zenhabits.net/44-toc/).

The last thing I wanna share with you is a post from the Zen Habits archive titled [The Magic of Being Held By the World](https://zenhabits.net/magic/).

## Conclusion

Meditation and mindfulness has given me benefits. Today I begin again. Yesterday I began again. Tomorrow I will begin again.

It took me longer than the initial 44 days to get through this program I ended on xx. It's almost ironic how I neglect this downtime and reflection during stressful periods when that's perhaps the most important time to reenergize.

So the four contemplations are:

The preciousness of life
The briefness of life
The inevitability of suffering
The awesome power of our actions

Namaste 🧘‍♂️
