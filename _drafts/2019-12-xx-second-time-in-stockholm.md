title: Second Time in Stockholm (2016-2019) - Decade Review part 2
---
Hello from a warm Brisbane! We are about to enter another year but also a new decade. I would like to take this opportunity and review my past ten years and share some of it in this post. This decade has been very fun and varied, yet demanding at the same time.  
In this second part I will talk about my life as after my return home, to Stockholm.<!--more-->

Känns som detta kan bli en stor post så håll det 80/20.

## Second Time in Stockholm (2016-2019)

Moved back to my parents in March 2016.

- **Move to Stockholm:** A big change this year was the move from Karlskrona and Blekinge where I have spent the last 6 and a half years. I longed back to Stockholm and just wanted to come home. I didn't feel well with a lot of stress and traded my job and apartment for unemployment and return to living with the family. Some positives and some negatives are a part of life.

Academic Work, Emric
- **New job:** In the beginning of the year I quit my job at CGI for an employment at Academic Work Technology working as a Software Developer helping [Emric](https://www.tieto.com/en/who-we-serve/financial-services/lending-and-finance/) (acquired by Tieto in September 2016) with their credit loan administration software. 6 months later the contract ended and I am currently studying C# and .NET while looking for practice or new employment.

TSM Running + klassikern... och typ diverse lopp...(länk till dreams Health & Fitness?)

- **Became a _runner_:** I have previously been running on and off but when I joined TSM Running back in June a spark if you will got lit and I realized how much good comes from running. Since then I have raced several times and the best day was when I ran Lidingöloppet 15 km.
- **New diet:** In December me and my sister went to a lecture with the Swedish athlete Jonas Colting. He spoke about how to be in fitness and in health. So the last few weeks I have been eating low carb and ketogenic food.
- Really proud of myself for doing the Swedish Classic. I've experienced both physical and mental growth this year.

- **Awaken the procrastinator:** A great frustration has been not getting things done and on time. By realizing this is a psychological behavior and doing some therapy exercises found in the book _Dance on deadline_, I am on my way to break this behavior and getting the right things done ahead of the deadline. **Therapy** skriv lite om det...
- **Less fixed mindset:** Among all the lectures I attended this year some gave me insights on finances, choosing your friends, realizing your potential and be successful in general.
- **Realization:** Society is not Black nor White. By reading the book _Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism_ I got more knowledge and understanding of the modern society and the politics and classes in it.
- **New blog:** This blog is all about my goals tied to my values. In 2017 I will get the following goals done:
  - Produce a music album with cover or original music
  - Run ASICS Stockholm Marathon on June 3
  - Take my drivers license for motorcycle

- **Meetups and events:** I found the great site for [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/) and have among others attended meetups for GTD, Arduino development, Code Nights, Lounge Hacks, Indie Game Dungeon. Here's my [post-mortem from Nordic Game Jam](/fun-recreation/2016/04/20/nordic-game-jam-2016-post-mortem.html).
- **Escape Room:** One of my favorite shows is Prison Break and for an hour I got to be Michael Scofield. Thanks to my boss at Emric who brought us to an escape room puzzle after work. They had several puzzles and I definitely will return in 2017 for more escaping menace.

- **Photoshoot:** Spent a day with Mathias as his model for some shots. [More photos by Mathias](https://www.facebook.com/MathiasAPhotography/).

[![Lidingöloppet](/assets/images/lidingo-2016.jpg)](/assets/images/lidingo-2016.jpg)
Lidingöloppet

Cyklade Lidingöloppet MTB 64 km. Det var kul men jobbigt. Pratade lite med Martin Stenmark och Peter Magnusson.

Cyklade Cykelvasan 90 på tiden 8:20:28. Hyrde en cykel på Skidmacken i Sälen. Det var en regnig och lång dag. Det jobbigaste jag gjort hittills.

Klassiker of Hope...

- **Has withdrawn from the Swedish church:** This is not a big deal since I hardly am religious. The money I will save from not paying tax can be spent in a better way. :) Angry Foreigner has a video on this topic as well.
- **Burning Dinner:** Went to the Node in Stockholm for a Spanish tapas dinner with sangria.
- **Giving money to those who deserve it:** I became a patron to [Angry Foreigner](https://www.patreon.com/EABT) for all his liberating videos. Other organizations that got my money and support was WWF, VISIR, A Non Smoking Generation and Skiftet (The Shift).
- **Tobacco Endgame:** I have been somewhat active spreading information about Tobacco Endgame and the dangers with tobacco on Facebook, through email and a letter to the editor that got published in Metro. It's a good cause and I will continue to help the organizations and the Swedish government to reach the target of a non smoking Sweden by the year 2025. I became a member of VISIR and helping them realize their goals.
- **Keep Sweden Clean:** I have been randomly picking litter as I took my walks around Stockholm. I encourage more people to care for the environment and to support _Håll Sverige Rent_.
- **TTIP:** Went to my first demonstration which was against TTIP and CETA.

**New job:** During my unemployment period (September 2016- April 2017) I applied and got in to Lexicon’s 16-week program in .NET development to improve my skills in full-stack Web Development. I met a lot of interesting people and among them my favourites Per and Atanas. During the studies I applied for different jobs and went on interviews with Handelsbanken, Metamatrix, tretton37, Cloud Nine, HiQ, Lexicon IT, Goodminton, Sigma Young Talent, Everdea, Lots Group, Decerno, Sogeti and the list goes on. A few companies wanted me to do coding assignments and have more interviews. In the end I decided to sign a job contract with tretton37 and have been working there as a .NET Ninja since the studies finished in April.

**Intermittent fasting:** For most weeks during the year, I’ve had an eating gap from Sunday dinner to Monday dinner where I only drank water or tea (sometimes with coconut oil).

**New Productivity Tool:** I would say my productivity has been a roller coaster aligning with how I was feeling at different times during the year. Some low lows and high highs. Deleted my accounts at Wunderlist, Moo.do and Zenkit and migrated my to-do lists to [Todoist](https://todoist.com). I have found a much better structure now for organizing my life and late 2017 I reached [Karma](https://todoist.com/karma) level *“Todoist Master”*.

**Nordic Game Jam:** Once again I travelled to Copenhagen for some weekend game hacking. The theme was *“Not there”* and it resulted in a VR game called [What's There?](https://rasmusnordling.itch.io/whats-there).

The objective of the game is to figure out what that weird object is that’s been placed in the room. Use the tools and your imagination to conduct various experiments to narrow the options. Game was made by me, Jakub Švehla and Michail Nenkov.

**Running:** I would be a fool not to mention all my exercise as something that went well (part from an injury). Started running with adidas Runners thanks to Per for recommending it. In December I replaced some of my running with Nordic walking (jogging with poles) to prepare for the upcoming skiing. New **Personal Best for 10K is 50:34** (MilSpåret).

## What Did Not Go Well

**Running injury:** During one of my hill running workouts I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my calf which turned out to be an injury that meant I had to go to rehab training and miss a few workout sessions and races. I limbed for about a week but quickly recovered so the muscle probably wasn’t completely off.

**Habit Challenge:** I did several attempts to stop biting my fingernails. But it’s not been a habit that I could keep permanently. Longest streak according to my journal was 96 days from January 24 to April 30.

**Volunteering:** Was board secretary for VISIR Stockholm/Uppsala between January to September.
I didn’t really handle all the extra work very well and I put a lot of hours and energy into something I later had to drop because of a frustration that wasn’t aligning with what I wanted with my life.
I still plan to engage in activities to reach the goal of a tobacco free society some day with year 2025 being the closest target.
As an own side project I bought the domain *tobakspodden.se* to be used for a podcast that didn’t really take off and is still In the initial planning phase.

**Meetups:** Attended several meet ups in different areas. Learned more about politics, Software Development, Songwriting and tips for starting a podcast.

- Went to *Blueberry work & travel exhibition* and got more information regarding Australia and also studying at the [ICMP](https://www.icmp.ac.uk/) in London
- *Haninge Musicians* guitar jams and co-hosting a songwriting workshop
- *YOGATHON STHLM 2017* with the yogi Swami Jyothirmayah & Stockholm Culture Festival. Morning yoga in a rainy Kungsträdgården followed by lunch, ice cream, meditation and breathing exercise with my buddy [Atanas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atanas-f-nikolov/)
- Several [Foo Café's](http://www.foocafe.org/) in Hammarby sjöstad and [Code Nights](https://www.meetup.com/codenight/) in Hornstull

**Political and Sustainable Development:** Spending several days in Almedalen visiting my sister and engaging in political discussions was the **highlight of 2017**. Some of the other political events I've been to include:

- Tobacco Endgame/Global Development seminars that I mentioned [in this post](/2017/05/19/weekly-news/)
- Public seminars about NATO- among the organizers was Vänsterpartiet (Left party)
- Stockholm Act, Global Bar and a concert with José Gonzalez
- People's Climate March Stockholm – Together for a Sustainable Future!

**Therapy:** Since September I’ve been seeing a therapist about my procrastination and fear of burning out. I have done a mixture of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Mindfulness exercises. We have touched on several topics to improve my life and more of this in an upcoming post perhaps.

**Knowabunga & Leetspeak with tretton37:** I visited Berlin for the first time and had curry wurst, German beer, some ninja adventure and looked at the view from the [Berlin Fernsehturm](https://tv-turm.de/en/homepage/). I’ve also been to my first developer conference, [Leetspeak](https://leetspeak.se/2017/) in Stockholm with talks about _“Build For The Globe!”_.

## Conclusion

This is the second part of my decade review. Part 1 is called My Life in Blekinge (2010-2016) and the final part in the series are Moving to Brisbane, Australia (2019).

Hope you got something out of skimming through these posts. I sure got many chuckles traveling down memory lane.
