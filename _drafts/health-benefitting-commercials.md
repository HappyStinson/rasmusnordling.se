The Need for health benefitting Commercials

Did you notice something special the first weeks in January. Right after the new year had begun.

At least in Stockholm there was an increase in the amount of propaganda targeted to smokers who want to quit.

Now, I'm not a big fan of the poison that is tobacco nor the industry behind it that kills 6 million people. Every year.

This week is asthma week ? and since I have astma which is a cronic desease and I want to 

direct this message to hälsominister <namn>, the different commercial broadcasting networks in Sweden to
highlight the importance of mindfully choosing the commercials that's a healthier choice for the population
and stop spamming us with the zillion differnt casino games, whom I assume generate a lot of ad revenue.
Why else would you show it down our throaths in the way you are doing today?
I'm not an expert on addictive behaviours but I would place a pretty big bet on bet365 or whatever that your
choice of displaying that much gambling commercials triggers the addictive personalities creting a negative spiral for the whole society.

Gambling ads is far from the only thing that is bad for our society. Sugary breakfast cereals in equally bad.
As I see it there is alot of room for improvement.

So again, please tell me what your commercials is contributing to our society and lastly choose them more mindfully and not just by who makes you richer.

If I do get a response, I will update this post accordingly for the sake of transparancy.

Don’t try to control what you can’t control. When we try to control others, or obsessively control our surroundings, we are trying to control things that aren’t in our control. This will inevitably end up in failure, frustration, and conflict with others. Instead, accept that we can’t control these things, and flow around the obstacles with a minimum of effort.
