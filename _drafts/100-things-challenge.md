## Living Life to the Fullest with Minimal of things

> As an experiment, write down the number of things you think you actually need. Then, write a list of all the things that you own. If the number of things you actually own exceeds your ideal need list, then it's time to organize. - Minns inte källan...

2018 year of mnmlism (länk till wikipedia?)

reduce, reuse, recycle.

Remove excess clutter that doesn't bring value or joy. Digital detox of everything from subscriptions to Facebook.

Is it possible to limit my possessions to 100 things and sell, donate, recycle everything else?

With less stuff I will free up both physical and mental space.

Goal: Clean my closet and go from using 4 to 1 shelf

1 year dedicated to the Pursuit of Simplicity

Learning to say *No*. I can't even be mad or disappointed anymore when people I ask for help says no. "Yes takes time. No makes time".

Hiding everything you don't wanna see. Eliminate excess and focus on the essentials.

I have thought this through and haven't seen any obstacles.

I don't waste my time and energy on worrying about the unknown future if I can avoid it. But were it to happen that I for instance is laid off or my computer/phone breaks the plan is to use public computers e.g. in the library and buy a *"dumbphone"* with kontantkort(?).
