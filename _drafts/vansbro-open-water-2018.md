#Race Day
Breakfast
4 h Car Ride to Vansbro from Stockholm
Picking up the envelope and buying some “salva”
Long que waiting in line for the start…
Compared to the other races which is held in cities, Vansbro stands out for being such a small and remote community. It was a lot of walking on gravel along the train tracks to get to the start. Charming in its way.
 
##Race
Got water in my mouth
Hard to crawl
Rubber smell
A lot of snot
First 1000m went quickly
Saw my parents standing on the bridge and I gave them a little wave.
Swam as close to the line as possible and overtake some slower swimmers
The last 1000m were tougher
Fog inside the goggles
Sun in my eyes, hard to see
Somewhat crowded, alternated between crawl and breaststroke
Stayed as close to the brygga as possible
Stretched my calves in the last 500 m and had to rest by the “brygga”
When I approached the finish I heard the speaker say my name so I gave a little wave.
Live music believe it was Mr.Big to be with you cover, I gave them the horns and got one back.
Hard to breathe in wetsuit only shallow breaths
##Result
01:18:13
#Aftermath
Picture with the medal
Saw and said hello to Niklas Bergh from the podcast Lagom kondition
Shower
FOOD

By for now. The next race in the Swedish Classic Circuit is Lidingöloppet 30 km but before that I’m running Stockholm Half Marathon in early September. Maybe I see you there?

It’s a pleasure keeping your body and mind in shape. By sharing some thoughts and experiences from my “active lifestyle” I hope to inspire more people to reflect on their own situation and in the long run improve public health.

Vansbrosimningen is the shortest race in the Swedish Classic Circuit…
Now I have tried the different challenges and would potentially be a Swedish Classic unless I failed the skiing. 
Skiing and swimming has been my weakest spots. Running and cycling seems to be no problem.

I’m glad I decided to do the full races as it has been easier than I imagined. It has only teased my curiosity and I want to continue with the different dicipöones and one day do a full-length triathlon.
