title: 2020 Year End Review
---
Another year has come to an end and 2020 has been challenging for a lot of people all over the planet.
In this post I reflect on my progress this year and am looking forward to reach new outcomes in the coming year.<!--more-->

I struggle to consistently do weekly and monthly reviews (especially during a hectic trimester) but at the end of every year I take some time to reflect on where I want to take my life next. It's an opportunity to share a slice of my life and hopefully it gives value to someone out there. üôÇ

What did go according to plan, what did not, in what ways did I change, what pop culture did I consume, and what do I look forward to in 2021? Keep on reading to find the answers.

## Rasmus Nordling's 10 Goals for 2020

At the beginning of the year I wrote down these nine (no. 10 has disappeared) goals below that I believed would take me closer to some of my [dreams](/dreams) and close the gap to my full potential.

I have put down *fear of failure* as one of my Comfort Zone Challenges and I think it's very natural not wanting to fail, but I've come to realize it's better to set BIG, ambitious goals and maybe fail rather than going safe. There's always opportunity for growth in every failed attempt.

Goals I thought would be accomplished in 2020:

1. I scuba dive in the ocean by the end of the year
2. I exercise for 150 minutes each week to prioritize my health, by the end of October
3. I sleep for 8 hours each night by the end of the year
4. I meditate most days of the week by the end of the year
5. I review my goals and plan the coming week, weekly by the end of the year
6. I have diversified my savings in four buckets with varied risk by the end of the year
7. I explore Australia and do fun activities with friends on the weekends by the end of the year
8. I release my debut album with 10 songs and 30 minutes of original music by the end of the year
9. I live in a share house in Brisbane with less than 200 AUD rent/week by week 6 2020

I watched this video by Brian Tracy on [How to Create an Effective Action Plan](https://youtu.be/haRCpUOCG_M) and intentionally set goals in different areas for me to grow.

My **Business & Career** goal went from *I release my debut album with 10 songs and 30 minutes of original music by the end of the year* which is more a personal achievement, to me more focusing on passing all my subjects at uni. Assessments have priority over recreational songwriting.  

I collaborated with producer [9/10](https://open.spotify.com/artist/01rj0l4H7V9LvfyuqvaxIH?si=DDBcbMCCQOmZMrk6_eRtTQ) on some unreleased songs in the beginning of the year. In trimester 2, Brisbane went into a lockdown due to COVID and we transitioned into online learning with BlueJeans and Zoom. I kept my head down and adapted to the circumstances. I managed to do all of my assessments with decent grades, without access to the campus facilities.

> Although I admit, at times I woke up just in time to join the lecture.

For Ensemble in trimester 2 me and Sarah rearranged popular songs into disco style.

I then had my scheduled break between June - September where I focused on my personal growth and joined *RedStone* as a guitarist. We worked on and performed original songs, drove to Old Petrie Town for a photoshoot, and recorded the single *Drifting Away*.

What about Sarah you might ask? She continued with trimester 3 and formed [Flight of Thoughts](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RvOfogp2PoWCsu1HdHgBo?si=_Ghvp2mdRIezC_2O8xuZoA).

After the break I resumed my degree and formed the "guitar driven rock band" *Junktion* with Mandy (vocals), Rob (vocals/guitar/keyboard) and Joohan (drums), while playing with RedStone.
Junktion recorded the single *Righteous Brother* (that I wrote) with producer Steve James, who also produced Drifting Away.

> Righteous Brother sounds like [Island in the Sun](https://youtu.be/erG5rgNYSdk) and [Mighty Quinn](https://open.spotify.com/track/1peVJH2dA6soU5cLVyM40Y). - Lecturers at JMC Academy

I enjoyed attending masterclasses in Guitar (Simon Gardner), Vocals (Emma Wilson and Shamus Kirkpatrick), Songwriting (Loic Valmy), and to perform with my talented mates several times at [the zoo](https://thezoo.com.au/) during the trimesters.

Some assessments:

- Analysed Karma Police and Money, and wrote a Music Tech Report (let's not talk about it)
- Arranged Phil Collins - Another Day in Paradise into hard rock (inspired by Ghost, The Offspring, and KISS) with score for a band with a contemporary horn section (trumpet, saxophones, and trombone)
- Remixed [Speak Softly - Broken Man](https://youtu.be/thC0RCrVWFo)
- Produced a song to the vocal stems from Lorde - Homemade Dynamite

Outside of regular assessments, RedStone took on several collaboration projects this trimester:

- Recorded our debut EP with help from our Audio Engineering mates Alex, Connor and Nato. Keep your üëÇ and üëÄ open for *The Long Way Round*
- Shot a music video for *Ghost Train* üëªüöÇ
- Produced a game trailer soundtrack for Animation student Jason
- Covered Shania Twain's - No One Needs to Know for a trimester 2 audio project. We also played a gig at the Loft in West End for the audio students to practice live sound with a band
- Performed together with [Lavelin](https://www.facebook.com/LAVELINindie), [Khara Van Park](https://www.facebook.com/KharaVanPark) and [Piece Of Mind](https://www.facebook.com/Piece-of-Mind-Music-101834765095141/) at *The Flamin' Galah*, where we played for an hour and had more freedom over the setlist (sadly no dancing allowed)

Although I managed to pull through, there were some doubts in the beginning of tri 3 whether I should keep going, drop some subjects or just defer for some time. I then had a remote session with Sydney counsellor Rochelle and the rest is (music) history...
I've mostly struggled with Ear Training and Guitar Performance this year and underestimated the workload of assessments.

A reminder that I should keep on top of my music studies.

You deserve a reading break for making it here. Allow yourself to *Drift away* to the single while browsing some of our photos. üì∑

My **Health & Fitness** focus was to *exercise for 150 minutes each week to prioritize my health, by the end of October*.

I went out for a 5,8 km run on 16 January after battling a sore throat. It was the first proper exercise since I rode *Cykelvasan* 94 km in August 2019. I followed a marathon training plan (intervals, long runs, distance runs) and looked forward to Brisbane Marathon. Every run had a purpose and intended [intensity zone](https://www.freeletics.com/en/blog/posts/training-intensity-zones/). I reluctantly logged all activities via my iPhone (Runcoach app), when I didn't have a working GPS watch.  
During my break from uni I started running more with ambitions on going ultra (distances longer than marathon).

Events & Races:

- Ran a whooping 3,8 km on Global Running Day
- Ran the charity runs [Coronamilen](https://raceid.com/sv/races/6965/about) 21.1 km in June, and [Mustaschmilen](https://www.mustaschkampen.se/artiklar/mustaschmilen) 10 km in November
- Ramboll Stockholm Halvmarathon Virtual Edition 2020 21,1 km in September. Stopped after 15 km and a time of 1:30:11
- [River Run 100 - Sunrise Marathon](https://riverrun100.com.au/events/42-2km-sunrise-marathon/) 42,2 km in October with a 5 AM start. Ran the same 5 km along the river 8 times and finished as they were packing up after 6 1/2 hours (long story).
- The Ultra X #Holiday100 66,28 / 100 km (8:58:46) between 24-31 December
- ~~Icebug Xperience Gaustablikk~~ and ~~Icebug Xperience Mountain Trail Weekend~~ both in Norway, got cancelled due to COVID

Stats:

- Total distance ran in 2020: 661 km
- Running peaked at 152,5 km in June vs. lowest point of 19,51 km in November ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Avg Weekly Distance: 12,5 km
- My only cycling this year was when I rode a CityCycle 7 km from Teneriffe ferry to Dutton Park at 2 AM (another long story)
- Picked up a habit of Monday intermittent fasting again in January. Was fairly consistent with it over the year but allowed me some days to eat

[The Running Experience](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjGZ6D8hJFvLur5K_p9vKAA) on YouTube has helped me with follow along warm-ups and cooldowns, among other good things.

Here is my [Garmin Connect profile](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/cd029f9a-6fa0-49d3-88e3-9430a5c47991), if anyone wants to compare stats or just stalk me. That's fine too!

*I sleep for 8 hours each night by the end of the year*:

Well... I like to sleep during the weekends but I rarely go to bed before midnight, especially if I'm in *the zone*. Things I tried was to be out in the sun for 30 mins each day, and go to bed while listening to the ASMR Meditation app [Synctuition](https://synctuition.com/) since January. I'm soon at level 4 after having listened to 54 25-minute episodes. I used Garmin-data and Excel to calculate an average sleep of 7.4 hours.

*I meditate most days of the week by the end of the year*:

Early in January I found Tanja Dyredand's video [Introduction to the Art of Doing Nothing (#TomGlo)](https://youtu.be/A4i00wBpTZ8). I started my mornings with 5 minute short meditations and got back in to the habit.  
Then I attempted to do [Zen Habits 44 Training Program](https://zenhabits.net/44-toc/) for the second time. Basically it's 11 practices done for 4 days each, that improves patience, awareness, compassion and other good stuff. I kind of did it all with some gaps where I got off track. I have drafted a separate blog post on this if you would like to know more. Leo Babauta from Zen Habits is one of the main reasons I got myself meditating in 2014-ish.
I also meditated 4 hours with the app Oak.

I have been mostly healthy and managed to stay safe from the virus. I did take a test once and spent time isolated to be on the safe side when I felt warm one morning.

[![Inspirational quote](/assets/images/oak-quote.png)](/assets/images/oak-quote.png)

The outcome with my **Financial Goals** is to have my money work for me and utilize the [8th Wonder of the World, compound interest](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/compound-interest/).

*I have diversified my savings in four buckets with varied risk by the end of the year*:

I'm guilty of keeping most of my eggs (savings) in the same basket/bucket. The plan was to follow a guide from *RikaTillsammans* to [structure my savings in 4 buckets](https://rikatillsammans.se/fyra-hinkar-strategin/) as a better way to spread the risk.
I did take some action by doing a budget but I sort of got stuck in a Catch 22 when trying to work out how large buffer (1st bucket) I need.

*I live in a share house in Brisbane with less than 200 AUD rent/week by week 6 2020*:

I wanted to move out of the share house in Fairfield and after doing some research, I applied to [Raymont Residential College](https://raymont.com.au/) in Auchenflower. Turned out to be a really good choice that has improved my life this year. It's an all inclusive college with a wonderful community. I think it beats living by your self and even with your parents. üòâ

[![Rasmus bedroom in Fairfield](/assets/images/bedroom-fairfield.jpg)](/assets/images/bedroom-fairfield.jpg)
This was my bedroom in Fairfield where I lived between October 2019 - February 2020.

[![Rasmus bedroom door at Raymont College](/assets/images/raymont-43.jpg)](/assets/images/raymont-43.jpg)
My door in Unit 4 at Raymont, themed *Decades*.

I also opened an Australian bank account at Bankwest to transfer SEK --> AUD with [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/invite/u/rasmusn39) (invite that gives you a free international transfer of up to A$1000).

I had to apply for an Australian Tax File Number to give to my bank in Sweden.

Let's be honest **Planning, Reviewing & Organizing** haven't been my strengths.

*I review my goals and plan the coming week weekly by the end of the year*:

At least I get more stuff done since I started using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/rasmus_nordling_aleibd), but I need to build a habit of reviewing my goals and make sure I don't lose sight of my outcomes.
Did about 16 weekly reviews this year. üò¨ One thing that helped me was having weekly calls with my family (accountability) that forced me to recap my journal and review my completed tasks.  
Here's a good article called [Create a Weekly Attack Plan](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/weekly-plan/) that I got inspiration from.

I didn't do much with the **Recreational** goals. *I scuba dive in the ocean by the end of the year* has been put on hold.

For Australia Day üá¶üá∫ I didn't know what to do so I went in to Fortitude Valley but it was hardly any party happening. I had a drink with a girl and she pointed out that the bartender was her BF and then she was off to work. üëç I was later told that a park, beach, or backyard is where most people hang out... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I have seen some live music this year including: JMC trimester performances at venue and in the auditorium, recital performances from graduating students, Virtual Blues on Broadbeach, Innerocken - particularly [Strange Days](https://youtu.be/Jv9nJD_h0tc?t=22150), 2020 Virtual APRA Music Awards (similar to Grammy Award and Grammisgalan).

~~Book of Mormon musical~~ excuses got in the way  
~~Elton John Farewell Yellow Brick Road~~ didn't get a ticket  
~~Live Music at Gr√∂na Lund~~ in Stockholm, cancelled due to COVID

## What went well? / What did I do right (or well) this year? üëç

**College life:** Probably the best decision this year was moving to the Raymont College. I have gotten many new mates, good food, and a safe community to be part of during hectic times this year.

- Performed Cat Stevens Father and Son with Daniel Grammon and G-Man on Father's Day in September
- Attended Music tutorials with Scarlett Gallery to get help with assessments
- Studied outside of my room to be more productive
- Applied for Spirit of Raymont Scholarship ($1000 that goes toward paying rent) - Waiting for decision

**Relationships:**

- Skyped with my parents and sister more or less every weekend since I arrived in üá¶üá∫
- 10 year anniversary with my friend Mathias. Rang him up a couple of times during the year to ask for life advice, from someone 2 days older. Here's us performing my song [Empty Apartment](https://youtu.be/8o8z3_cP7Vg)
- Caught up with my Bulgarian friend, Atanas via Zoom
- Conversed with Jelena from Serbia again ü¶å (met her via [Slowly](https://getslowly.com) in 2018)
- Met heaps of fantastic JMC students and alumni this year üòÅ
- Met Maako Ishikawa, the second Swede üá∏üá™ currently studying at the Brisbane campus ü™Å
- Reconnected with [Gabbe](https://soundcloud.com/devour-the-intestines), Emil, and Niklas on Facebook
- Reconnected with [Elina](https://soundcloud.com/elinajohansson) on SoundCloud
- Formed many new friendships this year with residents at Raymont. I'm writing this in Primmer as I prepare for Christmas and wait for everyone to come back next year.

[![Note from friend at Raymont College](/assets/images/raymont-blessing.jpg)](/assets/images/raymont-blessing.jpg)

**Are You Still Awake? Here's for the nerds** ü§ì

- Updated my MacBook's macOS from High Sierra (10.13) to Catalina (10.15.7)
- Updated my iPhone's iOS from 12.4.1 to 13.6.1
- Transferred my domain name (rasmusnordling.se) from Miss Hosting to EgenSajt for a better deal on renewals

## What did not go well? / What did I do wrong (or poorly) this year? üëé

- Did not review the material from the previous trimesters before starting the next, especially after having a big gap between T2 and 3
- Trying to create a Facebook account with a fake name
- Trying to raise money for the Polished man Campaign. üíÖ [My campaign](https://my.polishedman.com/rasmus-nordling) only received one donation from my mate Chris. Maybe work on a better strategy for 2021
- Did not finish or publish my blog post drafts (they keep piling up)
- Installing Roland keyboard drivers and not being able to boot MacBook afterwards üò± (I solved it)
- Attempted Brian Tracy's 30 day affirmation challenge. Broke my streak on day 16. üòî
- Said some [FUCK Jante affirmations](https://youtu.be/znQwKeRillw) in Jan - Feb but never made it a habit
- Cracked the screen on my iPhone

*I do the 50/90 Challenge and write 50 songs between 4 July and 1 October*:

How do you get better at your craft? By practicing regularly and challenging yourself such as trying to write [50 Songs in 90 Days](http://fiftyninety.fawmers.org/user/happystinson). I completed 3 songs but then got way to busy in the trimester I suppose.

## Events

- Watching Formula One with good mates in Unit 11 üèé
- Day trip to Movie World on the Gold Coast and enjoyed some of the attractions

**Spiritual Encounters:**

- Went to the Uniting church in Yeronga and Mount Gravatt a couple of Sundays when I still lived in Fairfield. I also visited [Hillsong](https://hillsong.com/australia/brisbane/) twice before the lockdown to enjoy contemporary worship music. Stepped out of my comfort zone and went alone to meet new people. It was a mixture of singing, praying, taking communion, and gaining new insights and outlooks on life
- [Zen Habits Zoom Meditation](https://zenhabits.net/meditation/) üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Spent Christmas day in Mount Gravatt with my mate Jock and his large family. I had an Australian Christmas with lots of good food, drinks, laughter, and songs!

I have been to a couple of new **Meetups** this year:

- BrisRuby on Ruby development (this is a Jekyll blog after all)
- Brisbane Web Accessibility & Inclusive Design
- Stockholm Personal Productivity & GTD (attended remote twice)
- Burger Thursday üçî
- Jam with [Brisbane Rock Music](https://www.brisbanerockmusic.com/) in Lutwyche
- Jam with [BASEQ](https://www.baseq.org.au/) (Blues Association of South East Queensland) in Goodna
- Combined Yoga üßò and Positive Goal Setting ü•á Workshop in City Botanical Gardens
- Lunch and üçª with Thor üá∏üá™ and I returned his guitar that I borrowed on the night I arrived in Brisbane
- Karaoke in Surfers Paradise with Lee and Cassidy üé§
- Performed at Tiger Eye Open Mic with Lee
- ~~So, What's Your Story? "From 1940 to 2020 - A Live Retrospective."~~ didn't happen, or did it?

## How am I different?

- More confident
- Enjoy performing on stage
- Better at guitar
- A better musician
- Transcribing songs by ear (and eyes) and avoid tabs unless I'm stuck. Ear Training + Music Theory actually WORKS! üòá
- I pay more attention when listening to music. I have become better at hearing time signatures, cadences, rhythms, and drum parts
- Have fallen in love with contemporary worship music. Singing hymns is not so bad either
- After another two trimesters and halfway towards finishing my degree, I see myself more as a composer and arranger now that I've acquired new skills in those areas
- Have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQ5rf6RM2ZazrINwVcBC8Q)
- I bounce from screen to screen. Things like: Facebook, Messenger, and *Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow*

[![Screenshot of the game Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow](/assets/images/futurama-vegemite.png)](/assets/images/futurama-vegemite.png)

I turned 29... No wait, that was last year. I turned 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ in October.

At first I was just going to list all the artists and albums that I consumed over the year and then realized we're almost in 2021 now and it's way more convenient (and fun) to share music as playlists!üí°

Here's the 100 Songs from 2020 that the Spotify algorithm gave me.
