title: To live according to my life principles - part 2
category: personal-development
---

Hello again,
In this series of posts I will share my current version of my life principles and how well I live by them. This will both help you to understand where I’m at the moment and also help me to identify in what areas I’m failing.
Yesterday I tried to do my weekly/monthly review but got frustrated with organising in Wunderlist and ended up reading on Lifehack instead.
Anyone following the GTD-principles would agree that doing the weekly review is critical for staying on top of your life. So why do I struggle and procrastinate on this so much?
Well it might got to do with self reflection and I have been reflecting a lot lately. I actually came up with the idea for this post in the shower this morning and now I’m composing the beginning of it on my way to work.
The following quote comes from the [7Life System](http://highexistence.com/7life-system-the-simple-structure-that-will-change-your-life/).
“Your principles are the foundation on which you stand, and if you don’t define them, you leave it to the world to do so for you. The 7Life system has you define seven principles – those core values that state who you are, how you behave and how you operate.”
Rasmus 7 Life Principles that is current June 2017
Help myself first, then help those who do good for others
Encourage others to follow their dreams and offer my help
Don’t be judgmental towards strangers and avoid prejudice
Step out of my comfort zone as often as possible and face my fears regularly
[The Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule), “Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”
Always choose the healthier option
Make a difference for others and share my knowledge in a polite way when possible
Help myself first, then help those who do good for others
This is essential for achieving success. I agree it’s nice to help others and offer your
 
Encourage others to follow their dreams and offer my help
This sure sounds like a nice principle. I don’t really know what I’m doing to incorporate this in my day to day life.
I hope that I can inspire and motivate someone with my own journey but I should probably work a lot more in this regard.
Dare to dream and go out and find your true potential.
Don't be judgmental towards strangers and avoid prejudice
One of the harder principles to live by. We all have prejudice towards other people, more or less. A good proverb I heard is “trust everyone until proven wrong”.
Maybe I should have more faith in others and be less skeptical about their intentions?
Over the last year my life situation has changed forcing me to step outside of my comfort zone and meet many new people I probably never would´ve met otherwise.
New friendships are right around the corner, no matter if they’re from Bulgaria, Iran, China or Örebro.
“You become your company” “man blir som man umgås”.
I believe I´ve made progress in this area over the last year or so but my perception might not align with yours though, especially if you’re a smoker.
I would say smokers is the biggest collective I currently feel a lot of anger and frustration with. I know some of my statements on Facebook have been mean and generalised.
I’m very dedicated in the fight on tobacco and from time to time I meet or see someone that just puts gasoline on my flames. I’m sorry for not being able to keep a cool head at all times.
I can’t change the past but I can work harder going forward.

This is dedication with a lot of energy being used in a bad way.
Even though I target smoking, which the large majority dislikes I have to think about how I express myself. A few have already removed me from their Facebook contacts and I totally see why.

Principles I haven't covered yet

- Step out of my comfort zone as often as possible and face my fears regularly
- Boy scout rule
- Always choose the healthier option
- Make a difference for others and share my knowledge in a polite way when possible

Nämn tretton värderingar, några där som jag gillade… challenge the world/your self…

That was all for now, I have to practice on being more agile in my life and by breaking this up into smaller posts I can teach myself that publishing small “drafts” perhaps isn’t so scary.
Hopefully it will help me not procrastinating so much and I hope you all look forward to more content coming up!
As always, leave a comment if you have any questions, feedback or just want to contact me.
Be your best today
