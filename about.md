## Dream BIG

This blog is all about getting the most out of life.
I am set on a path and dedicated to improve all areas of my life and achieving my biggest goals.
I share my goals, habits and progress. Hope you will join me on this journey and that you tell me about yours 🙂.
This is a long-term project and the list of goals will change over time.
I start this in October 2016 and some topics I will cover are songwriting, music production, game development and physical fitness challenges.

The audience will be anyone who also want to achieve BIG goals or just looking for motivation or different ideas and perspectives.

I will be posting whenever something is worth sharing and I feel like writing. I am doing this to inspire others to constantly improve their lives and achieving their **BIGGEST** goals and dreams. Nothing is to big, it all starts with a small step. **Today**.

### Hello! I'm Rasmus. On a journey to accomplish my Life Goals. 🤘

Happy and proud minimalist from Sweden 🇸🇪 who likes playing the guitar and making music 🎸. I do some running and races 🏃‍♂️ 🏅. At work and sometimes at home I write code on my MacBook or whatever computer is close 👨‍💻. Care for health, fitness and the environment 😁.

Oh and by the way. Unless you didn't notice, I really like to use them cute [emojis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji).
