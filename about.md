## Dream BIG

This blog is all about getting the most out of life.
I am set on a path and dedicated to improve all areas of my life and achieving my biggest goals.
I share my goals, habits and progress. Hope you will join me on this journey and that you tell me about yours. üôÇ
This is a long-term project and the list of goals will change over time.
I start this in October 2016 and some topics I will cover are songwriting, music production, game development and physical fitness challenges.

The audience will be anyone who also want to achieve BIG goals or just looking for motivation or different ideas and perspectives.

New posts will be published when I have a need to share something. That can be race reports after a certain event or my *year end review* that I plan to publish every New Year's Eve. Expect more blog posts in 2021 as I finish up my drafts.

I am doing this partly as a pet project, partly because writing is quite therapeutical, but also to inspire others to constantly improve their lives and achieving their **BIGGEST** goals and dreams. Nothing is to big, it all starts with a small step. **Today**.

## Hej, I'm Ras!

**On a journey to accomplish my Life Goals.** ü§ò

I'm a Swede in my early 30's and I study [Songwriting at JMC Academy](https://www.jmcacademy.edu.au/courses/songwriting) in Brisbane and play guitar in the bands [RedStone](https://www.facebook.com/RedStone-102867844858279) and Junktion. I focus on songwriting, and mixing and producing in Logic Pro.
[Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/rasmus_nordling_aleibd) is my preferred tool for managing my projects and *get things done*.

My big passion besides music is running, and taking on demanding races and challenges. I need that time where I can appreciate the outdoors and discover new places.

One of my goals for 2021 is to make more videos and grow my YouTube channel [Ras World of Music & Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQ5rf6RM2ZazrINwVcBC8Q).

I'm a Libra and [INTP](https://www.mbtionline.com/en-US/MBTI-Types/INTP) who lives at [Raymont Residential College](https://raymont.com.au/).

I have a Bachelor's Degree in *Computer Science and Game Programming* from Blekinge Institute of Technology and have professional work [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmusnordling/) as a Web Developer.
